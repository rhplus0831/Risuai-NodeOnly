# PocketRisu codebase structure guide

Navigation map for developers and AI agents. Start here, choose the owning subsystem,
then use the change maps and symbol names in `docs/structure/`. Ownership and runtime
behavior were audited on 2026-08-09 against `e2f6d2ea`. File paths and symbols are the
durable references; line-number hints in the detail docs are approximate and should be
confirmed with `rg`.

## What PocketRisu is

PocketRisu is a self-hosted fork of [RisuAI](https://github.com/kwaroran/RisuAI): a
Svelte 5 + Vite browser client backed by one Express/Node process and a SQLite KV core.
Chats, optimized plugin values, ordinary assets, inlays, backups, and recovery history
use specialized row or filesystem stores around that core.

PocketRisu maintains selected RisuAI interchange surfaces, including Character Card
V2/V3, `.risup` prompt presets, `.risum` modules, and RisuSave `.bin` migration.
Compatibility is surface-specific rather than universally lossless. Upstream-target
backups omit PocketRisu inlay namespaces, encrypted risuai.xyz account backups are not
accepted, and PocketRisu-only state may have no upstream runtime meaning.

## Run and verify

Use pnpm 10.34.1 and Node 22.12 or newer; Node 24 is recommended and used by current
Docker/release builds. There is no aggregate `test:all` command. `pnpm test` runs the
client suite followed by the server suite; `test:server` reruns only the latter.

Pushes to `serve`, pull requests into `main`, and the tag-driven release and Docker
workflows all run the same CI gate (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`): svelte-check,
build, both unit suites, and the compatibility suite. The gate fails on compat cases
skipped outside the known fixture-gated allowlist in `scripts/check-compat-skips.mjs`.
The Playwright E2E trace suite is outside this reusable gate.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Frontend-only Vite server on `0.0.0.0:5174` with a strict port; no `/api` proxy |
| `pnpm build` | Production build with sourcemaps to `dist/` |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview `dist/` on `localhost:4173` by default; still no backend API |
| `pnpm runserver` | Start Express from the repository root; serves `dist/` on `$PORT` (default 6001), binding `$HOST` when set and otherwise all interfaces |
| `pnpm check` | Svelte and TypeScript diagnostics |
| `pnpm check:help` | Validate localized help-key coverage |
| `pnpm check:docs` | Validate documentation links and the generated findings work index |
| `pnpm test` | Browser/client unit tests under `src/` in happy-dom, followed by the server unit suite |
| `pnpm test:server` | Node server unit tests with real `better-sqlite3` |
| `pnpm test:compat` | Real-server storage/interchange integration tests: imports, exports, atomicity, caches, plugin storage |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright E2E trace harness against the built app and isolated real servers; requires a current build and is outside the CI gate |
| `pnpm test:performance` | Isolated performance suite, run with resource cache disabled and enabled |
| `pnpm test:performance:extreme` | Opt-in 448 MiB plugin transition stress test targeting roughly 2 GiB peak RSS; performs memory/disk preflight and never runs from the default performance command |

The upstream-backup fixture suite runs only when the ignored local file
`test/fixtures/upstream/upstream-backup.bin` is supplied. Most `test/compat/` coverage
tests PocketRisu persistence and interchange behavior, not execution inside upstream.

```

- `server/node/server.cjs` remains the Express composition root. It keeps some
  asset/chat endpoints inline and wires subsystem modules under
  `server/node/{assets,backup,chat,db,plugin-storage,runtime}/`. Extracted route
  families include `backup/backupRoutes.cjs`, `db/maintenanceRoutes.cjs`,
  `plugin-storage/pluginStorageRoutes.cjs`, and
  `runtime/{proxy,observability,selfUpdate,model-jobs}.cjs` beneath that root.
- The browser holds the whole `Database` proxy in `DBState.db`. Unopened chats are
  runtime `_placeholder` objects; full bodies hydrate lazily. Database persistence
  replaces every chat with a wire `_stub` and saves authoritative chat rows first.
- The opt-in IndexedDB resource cache stores verified, hash-addressed bytes plus
  resource manifests. It is disposable; the Node server remains authoritative.
- Payload-sized client encoding, hashing, and chat-delta preparation use a browser
  codec worker; the server disk-spools selected admitted writes and plans chunks in
  bounded worker threads, with synchronous fallbacks when worker offload is unavailable.
- `TRACE_REQUEST_FOR_DEBUG=true` writes bounded debug traces under `save/trace`; the
  server also exposes authenticated plugin-storage recovery management routes.
- Default non-preview, tool-free `ModelPreset` requests use reconnectable
  `/api/model-jobs` for streaming and JSON responses, with the proxy-aware `/proxy2`
  path as a job-creation fallback. Previews, tool loops, or disabled server-side jobs
  use the normal direct/`/proxy2` transport.
- Classic model traffic goes directly from the browser when allowed or through
  `/proxy2`. Local OpenAI-style streaming can use restricted WebSocket proxy jobs with
  `/proxy2` fallback; non-streaming local requests use `/proxy2`.
- `server/hono/` remains a non-functional scaffold. The production server treats
  `process.cwd()` as the application root and does not load `.env` itself.
- Remote non-localhost use requires a secure browser context by default. Use HTTPS;
  `POCKETRISU_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTEXT` is an explicit operator escape hatch.

## Core runtime flows

### Send a message

`DefaultChatScreen.sendMain()` owns the global UI gate, commands, attachments, and input
transforms. `sendChatMain()` owns the target chat's generation guard and delegates to
`sendChat()` in `src/ts/process/index.svelte.ts`. The process layer assembles prompt
buckets, lore, memory, attachments, and token budgets. `requestChatData()` applies
request hooks, classic-versus-ModelPreset dispatch, retries, and provider/tool loops.
Responses surface as cumulative snapshots; output transforms run on a mode-dependent
cadence, output triggers run after completion, and the save loop then persists the
mutation. See [chat pipeline](docs/structure/chat-pipeline.md),
[model providers](docs/structure/model-providers.md), and
[scripting and extensions](docs/structure/scripting-extensions.md).

### Persist database and chat state

Ordinary UI code mutates `DBState.db`. `saveDb()` tracks deep reactive reads, stages
changed chat bodies to `/api/chat-content`, then commits the stubs-only database through
JSON Patch or an ETag-guarded full write. Generation checkpoints can persist bounded chat
operation-log deltas for asynchronous server compaction; full-row writes remain the
fallback. Plugin storage, drafts, assets, inlays, and destructive recovery use explicit
protocols rather than this implicit save loop. See
[client storage](docs/structure/client-storage.md),
[server backend](docs/structure/server-backend.md), and
[plugin storage](docs/structure/plugin-storage.md).

### Extend behavior

CBS expressions, regex scripts, Lua/triggers, JavaScript plugins, and MCP tools enter at
different lifecycle points. For `processScriptFull()`, Lua runs first; display triggers
run only for `editdisplay`; plugin handlers, CBS, and regex scripts follow. V2/V2.1
plugins execute in the page realm with compatibility guards; V3 plugins use an iframe
bridge and permissioned host APIs. See
[scripting and extensions](docs/structure/scripting-extensions.md).

### Export, import, and recover

Full/server exports require a valid live database and every referenced chat, then bind a
pinned WAL view to verified private filesystem copies. Partial exports and automatic
snapshots have explicit recovery-oriented missing-chat policies. Destructive imports and
restores stage bounded input behind the import barrier and report committed,
not-committed, or unknown outcomes. Character-package chat import/export and dataset
export process chat JSON incrementally instead of materializing every chat row at once. See
[backup and recovery](docs/structure/backup-recovery.md).

## Vocabulary that prevents expensive mistakes

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `chaId` | Durable character ID and first component of a chat-row key |
| `Chat.id` | Durable conversation ID used by chat rows, drafts, history, and caches |
| `Message.chatId` | Persisted message identity; generated replies usually start with the generation UUID, but continuations can preserve it while `generationInfo.generationId` changes |
| Request `arg.chatId` | Historical name for a main request's generation ID, used by status and request-log correlation |
| Numeric script/parser `chatID` | Message-array index, not a durable conversation ID |
| `ModelPreset` | Installed model configuration with a frozen profile snapshot, selected through per-chat bindings or optional global per-module overrides |
| Prompt preset / `botPreset` | RisuAI-format prompt template selected through `botPresetsId` |
| Ordinary asset | `assets/*`; safe names are normally files under `save/assets/` |
| Inlay | Payload under the versioned `save/inlays/.inlay-objects-v1/` physical namespace with disjoint, bounded, lowercase-hex payload/sidecar paths; logical `inlay_meta/<id>` KV separately tracks timestamps and character/chat ownership |

## Cross-cutting contracts

### Persistence and identity

- Chat placeholders must hydrate before message access. `_stub` is the wire marker;
  `_placeholder` is the browser-runtime marker. Guard layers that prevent message loss
  are intentional.
- Stable IDs and persisted numeric enums are compatibility contracts. Append enum values;
  never renumber them. Where selectors intentionally remain index-based—such as
  `botPresetsId`, `selectedPersona`, or `character.chatPage`—use their reorder/delete
  helpers so references move together.
- The public streaming iterator consumed by `sendChat()` yields cumulative snapshots.
  Provider and adapter parsers may handle deltas internally but must accumulate at that
  boundary. Output hooks therefore need to be repeat-safe.
- `requestImmediateSave()` returns an outcome. Code that requires durability must confirm
  `outcome.status === 'committed'` or use the committed-save helper; merely awaiting the
  call is insufficient.

### Client/server storage protocols

- Chat metadata allowlists, patch normalization/hashing, and RisuSave constants have
  coordinated client/server implementations. Shared JSON contracts centralize plugin
  key rules in `shared/plugin-save-key-policy.json` and character defaults/ID rules in
  `shared/character-defaults-policy.json`; server database ingest applies the latter
  before chat-row publication. Other paired contracts still require lockstep changes.
- Browser caches are non-authoritative. Cache hits, segmented DB assembly, and list deltas
  must fall back to a full authoritative read on malformed, missing, stale, or
  unverifiable state.
- `/api/session` registration does not steal mutation rights. Only a fresh,
  gesture-backed write can take over; stale writers receive 423 and must reload or stay
  frozen in recovery. Stale dirty state must never be replayed over the active writer.
- Writer mutations carry `x-client-build`. A mismatch with the server's `dist` build
  stamp is rejected with HTTP 426 `CLIENT_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`; clean pages reload and
  dirty pages enter writer recovery.
- Runtime KV/chat-row/asset/inlay mutations that can overlap a destructive import must use
  the storage queue. The held import transaction and startup recovery are deliberate,
  bounded exceptions.

### Plugin publications

- Optimized plugin storage is one generation-bound publication: database mode and
  `pluginStorageGeneration`, `plugin-storage/manifest.json`, value rows, and owner rows
  move together. Prefix rows absent from the matching manifest are quarantined physical
  data, not current state.
- Use the dedicated versioned mutation, batch, and generation APIs; mode changes use
  only the staged or bulk transition routes. The legacy non-bulk
  `/api/plugin-storage/transition` returns HTTP 426 and is not a live transition API.
  Generic KV writes never mutate those roots. Ordinary database patches may update the
  inline value/owner maps only after the server proves the authoritative mode is inline.
- Never replay a storage or destructive-replacement request whose commit outcome is
  unknown. Re-read or reload authoritative state and reconcile first.

### Backup, import, and compatibility

- Full and server-file exports require a valid live database and all referenced chats.
  Automatic snapshots and partial jobs deliberately preserve a bare stub for an already
  missing chat so damaged state still has a recovery point.
- Full exports combine one pinned SQLite view with verified private filesystem copies;
  their temporary data stays on the configured save/spool volumes.
- Imports are exclusive replacements. Bounded staging, the import barrier, the SQLite
  transaction, and the filesystem swap journal form one safety protocol.
- Upstream migration exports are intentionally lossy for PocketRisu-only inlays. RisuAI
  quirks such as `extentions`, RPack framing, legacy save fallbacks, and index-based
  `botPresetsId` are deliberate data-format contracts. The mutating `GET /api/remove` is
  a separate PocketRisu browser/server compatibility contract.

### Frontend conventions

- Svelte 5 runes and classic writable stores coexist. Non-component TypeScript modules
  that use runes need the `.svelte.ts` suffix. UI code binds directly into `DBState.db`,
  and the save loop depends on `deepTouch()` establishing deep reactive dependencies.

## Documentation maintenance

Approximate file sizes were removed from the root map because fast-moving storage and
plugin modules made them misleading. When code moves, prefer updating symbol ownership
and change maps over refreshing every line number. Treat `docs/findings/` and
`.archived-docs/` as point-in-time evidence whose resolution must be checked against
current code. `docs/findings/WORK-INDEX.md` is the current status catalog; source-specific
audit indexes live in `.archived-docs/` and must not be used as live status tables.
