## 1. Purpose & overview

The server backend turns the built Svelte SPA into a self-hosted PocketRisu instance. The production implementation is the Express executable in `server/node/server.cjs`: it serves `dist/`, authenticates and fences writers, persists the PocketRisu-internal stubs-only RisuSave database plus external chat/plugin rows, proxies model traffic, manages filesystem stores, and exposes maintenance and recovery protocols. Self-contained migration archives are assembled only at explicit export boundaries.

Persistent application data is primarily stored in SQLite through a binary-compatible key/value abstraction. `database/database.bin` contains character/settings data plus chat stubs; full bodies live in `chats/<chaId>/<chatId>` rows. Optimized plugin authority is selected by `Database.pluginStorageGeneration` and an exact `plugin-storage/manifest.json`: ordinary value/owner/manifest publications stay within that backend generation, while a mode transition atomically publishes a fresh generation with its database state and exact `pluginsave/` plus `pluginsave-meta/` rows. Every logical KV namespace can use protected content-defined chunks; namespace does not determine physical representation. Safe ordinary assets, inlays, server-created archives, private pins/stages, and per-chat pre-image history are filesystem-backed; unsafe, non-portable (Windows-reserved or trailing-dot), and host-case-colliding asset names remain KV rows. Destructive imports use an exclusive barrier plus a filesystem/SQLite commit journal. See [Plugin storage](plugin-storage.md) and [Backup and recovery](backup-recovery.md) for the cross-cutting protocols.

## 2. Key files

### Node implementation

The production inventory follows the subsystem folders under `server/node/`; the
composition root and cross-subsystem coverage anchors are listed separately.

#### Composition root and shared files

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/server.cjs` | Executable Express backend and lifecycle composition root. It owns auth/writer fencing, storage queues, shared chat/filesystem stores, automatic snapshots, startup recovery, and the mutable state crossed by extracted route families through ctx getters/wrappers. `startServer()` performs recovery/preflight/migrations before selecting HTTP/HTTPS and `HOST`/`PORT`; loading the module starts the application. |
| `server/node/utils.cjs` | Server-side implementation of RisuAI save formats, cached-read hash parsing, and patch-sync hashing. `RisuSaveType` must match the client enum; `decodeRisuSave()` accepts legacy raw, compressed, stream-compressed, and block formats; `calculateHash()`/`normalizeJSON()` must remain behaviorally aligned with the client. |
| `server/node/readme.md` | Declares this tree as PocketRisu's production backend, documents root-CWD startup, and explicitly distinguishes the incomplete Hono scaffold. |
| `server/node/ssl/Generate Certificate.sh` | Generates a local CA and server certificate into `server/node/ssl/certificate/`; see `server/node/ssl/Generate Certificate.sh:2`. |
| `server/node/ssl/Generate Certificate.bat` | Windows equivalent of the certificate-generation helper. |
| `server/node/ssl/ca.conf` | OpenSSL CA identity and extensions; CA constraints are at `server/node/ssl/ca.conf:16`. |
| `server/node/ssl/server.conf` | Localhost server certificate request. SANs are only `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` at `server/node/ssl/server.conf:16`. |

#### `assets/`

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/assets/assetStore.cjs` | Filesystem-backed implementation for safe `assets/*` keys, including atomic write/rename, SHA-256 filename verification, dual-source listing, migration, clear, and import staging helpers. |
| `server/node/assets/assetMaintenanceLock.cjs`, `assetDedup.cjs` | Cross-process exclusion shared by live asset mutations, destructive import swaps, journal recovery, and the controlled multi-instance dedup worker. Ancestor symlinks canonicalize to one identity; the swappable `assets` leaf itself may not be a symlink. Lock state lives beside that directory; dedup uses strict target and same-UID/GID/mode validation, locale-independent UTF-8 byte ordering, byte verification, link-to-hidden-temp, final inode/content/metadata revalidation, atomic rename, and directory fsync. |
| `server/node/assets/assetGc.cjs` | Bounded recursive asset-reference discovery, persisted candidate bookkeeping, and two-pass grace planning for server-owned ordinary-asset garbage collection. |

#### `backup/`

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/backup/importBarrier.cjs` | Abort-aware exclusive import gate. `acquire()` claims a FIFO turn before draining older mutations; abandoned waiters are removed safely, later writes are refused, and stable reads can wait with an `AbortSignal`. |
| `server/node/backup/importJournal.cjs` | Durable bridge between SQLite import transactions and filesystem asset/inlay directory swaps. It atomically writes/fsyncs `save/import_journal.json`, fsyncs staged trees, and recovers by finalizing committed swaps or restoring pre-import directories. |
| `server/node/backup/backupRoutes.cjs` | Full/partial export, archive import, server-file and chat-backup reads, save-folder migration, replacement-operation reconciliation, snapshot restore, boot-reminder, and server-backup-path routes through six position-preserving registrations. It owns full/partial pin and import machinery, the replacement registry, route-only restore failpoints and decode gate, and partial-export GC; shared automatic-snapshot/import-barrier/root state and the streaming-ingest restore gate remain in `server.cjs` and cross through ctx where needed. |
| `server/node/backup/backupImportIndex.cjs` | Private disk-backed SQLite index for large backup restores. `createBackupImportIndex()` bounds heap use while deduplicating archive names and tracking imported inlays, sidecars, and legacy metadata. |
| `server/node/backup/mcpToolCallRecovery.cjs` | Remembered MCP tool-call key/snapshot helpers and bounded marker scanners used to fold or recover only referenced `cache/mcp-tool-calls/*` rows across save, export, and import paths. |
| `server/node/backup/spoolOwnership.cjs` | Validates and atomically initializes persistent UUID files, claims a filesystem-safe installation spool namespace with the separate `__spool_owner_id` plus a canonical-save-root binding, and creates/revalidates the owned child of a configured shared root. Missing identities and claims use fsynced exclusive-link publication; invalid identities deterministically converge without a reclaimable lock pathname. Unsafe entries are atomically parked rather than conditionally unlinked. Identity/claim files and owned directories are accepted without following symlinks; POSIX hosts harden modes. POSIX boot cleanup quarantines the claimed child and sweeps through pinned old/fresh directory descriptors. Windows deliberately skips pathname-unsafe orphan sweeping and gives each process a fresh `.runtime-*` child within the stable owned namespace; stale children are retained for later safe recovery. Analytics `__instance_id` is not filesystem ownership. |
| `server/node/backup/streamRisuSave.cjs` | Object-based legacy encoder for already-materialized database state and compatibility export paths. |
| `server/node/backup/streamBackupRisuSave.cjs` | Seekable source-to-source transformer for point-in-time full/partial export and automatic snapshots, including folded external chat/plugin/MCP rows without monolithizing state in memory. |
| `server/node/backup/streamRisuLoad.cjs` | Bounded streaming inspector/decoder for supported RisuSave formats and snapshot/import ingestion. |
| `server/node/backup/streamJsonToMsgpack.cjs`, `jsonValidateWorker.cjs` | Bounded JSON validation and streaming conversion used by import/restore compatibility paths. |
| `server/node/backup/backupEntryFormat.cjs` | Archive header/framing, entry name/body bounds, byte-size planning, and preflight. |
| `server/node/backup/importSpool.cjs` | Private bounded upload/file/ZIP ingress, central-directory/CRC validation, entry staging, cancellation, and cleanup. |

#### `chat/`

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/chat/chatRows.cjs` | Injected chat-row store and the monolith-ingestion boundary. It owns encoded chat keys, missing/duplicate-ID repair, stub semantics, referenced-row diff/sweep helpers, split/assembly, and the transactional `ingestFullDatabase()` and `ingestStreamingDatabase()` paths. Duplicate `chaId` repair happens before row keys are finalized. |
| `server/node/chat/characterDefaults.cjs` | Loads `shared/character-defaults-policy.json` and applies its nullish character defaults and missing character/persona/preset ID rules during migration and both monolith-ingest paths. |
| `server/node/chat/chatDelta.cjs` | Defines and validates the v1 chat-operation envelope and restricted message JSON Patch, then applies a validated delta without weakening base/result commitments. |
| `server/node/chat/chatBackups.cjs` | Per-chat pre-image history. Logical IDs use a reversible lowercase-only physical encoding when Windows-reserved, trailing-dot, uppercase/case-colliding, or otherwise non-portable; collision-safe lowercase legacy directory names stay stable and every legacy form remains readable. Ordinary overwrites are best-effort and enforce a 45-second per-chat cooldown; structural chat deletion forces a cooldown-exempt capture and fails closed. Reconciliation streams each loose version into an atomic, self-describing `.frame` containing one independent gzip member, enforces the exact 125-version default plus a 256 MiB per-chat uncompressed-byte default, applies the separate globally age-ordered compressed-disk budget, and restores exact raw bytes by inflating only the selected frame. Legacy solid v1 bundles remain readable and migrate through bounded one-pass extraction without becoming authoritative until every replacement is durable. |
| `server/node/chat/bufferedIngress.cjs` | Pre-parser admission for buffered JSON, octet-stream, and text bodies, plus identity-only admission for bodyless/direct-stream writers. It resolves auth/writer/route-limit policy, rejects retired protocols and mismatched client builds before reading a body, strictly validates uncompressed `Content-Length`, and reserves/relinquishes the process-wide in-flight byte budget without performing a writer-lock transition. |
| `server/node/chat/admittedIngressSpool.cjs` | Post-admission disk ingress for raw `/api/write` and raw/JSON chat-row writes. It consumes the already-reserved request in bounded pages, fsyncs a private spool in the installation-owned configured-spool namespace, preserves the reservation through response finish/close, and maps spool-volume pressure to the admission layer's retryable refusal. |

#### `db/`

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/db/db.cjs` | Opens `save/risuai.db`, applies SQLite pragmas, owns KV/delta-list primitives, pins read-only WAL snapshots, initializes chunks, and maintains derived plugin usage/owner indexes and atomic quota plans. |
| `server/node/db/chunkStore.cjs` | Protected content-defined storage for the live DB, automatic snapshots, chat rows, and plugin values. It owns manifest metadata/publications, logical size/SHA verification, bounded raw-row streaming, snapshot sharing/cost, and mark/sweep GC. |
| `server/node/db/chunkPlan.cjs`, `chunkPlanWorker.cjs` | Bounded worker-thread preparation for private file sources. At most two workers by default scan FastCDC boundaries and compute per-chunk SHA-256 plus logical SHA-256/MD5 in one bounded-window pass; queued publication validates the immutable file identity and exact planned bytes. |
| `server/node/db/atomicJsonPatch.cjs` | Copy-on-write RFC 6902 application for the retained decoded database. `applyPatchAtomic()` clones only mutation paths so a failed patch cannot partially mutate the live cache while untouched branches retain reusable identity. |
| `server/node/db/generationMemo.cjs` | Generation-bound derived-value memo with process-unique generation tokens, used for canonical database encodings, hashes, and ETags without ABA reuse after cache replacement. |
| `server/node/db/maintenanceRoutes.cjs` | Storage dashboard and database maintenance routes: `/api/db/stats` (+`/characters`, `/modules`), `/api/db/optimize`, `/api/db/durability` GET/PUT, `/api/db/wal-checkpoint`, non-restore `/api/db/snapshots` (limits/list/delete), and `/api/assets/cleanup`. The durability/WAL engine and snapshot-limit persistence/rotation stay in `server.cjs`; destructive snapshot restore is registered immediately afterward from `backupRoutes.cjs`. Mutations cross only through named server-side wrappers such as `persistSqliteDurabilityMode()`, and mutable paths/ETag are read through getters at request time. |
| `server/node/db/stageRowDownload.cjs` | Opens one validated read-only descriptor for a staged plugin transition row and streams from that same descriptor, avoiding a validation/reopen race. |
| `server/node/db/dbCachedRead.cjs` | Server half of the optional segmented boot-read protocol. It validates the client's hash inventory, splits the stubs-only database into root/character/preset/module/persona MessagePack segments, and emits bytes only for cache misses while preserving the full-view ETag. |
| `server/node/db/databaseRevision.cjs`, `revisionBoundCache.cjs` | Transactional generation tracking and bounded decoded-cache reuse for `database.bin`. SQLite triggers advance a monotonic operational revision on insert, key/value update, and delete; clean decoded entries are revision-checked and LRU/size/heap-pressure evictable, while acknowledged dirty patch state remains pinned until persistence or explicit invalidation. |
| `server/node/db/dbCachePersistence.cjs` | Synchronous core of dirty database-cache persistence, extracted from `persistDbCacheGeneration()`: graph guards (`findStubFlagLossChats`, duplicate chat IDs), plugin externalization, canonical encoding, and the single commit transaction. `runEmergencyDbFlush()` is the guarded fatal-exit variant: it skips on import, owned transaction, no pending work, stale/empty/non-normalized cache, or guard rejection, and never deletes chat rows because pre-image capture is asynchronous. |
| `server/node/db/listDelta.cjs` | Builds full or delta `/api/list` responses from KV modification timestamps, the deletion journal, filesystem mtimes, and the list epoch. Delta eligibility is capped at six days. |

#### `plugin-storage/`

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/plugin-storage/pluginStorageRoutes.cjs` | All `/api/plugin-storage/*` routes (clear, state, viewer, manifest, reconcile-boot, recovery, batch, mutate, staged/bulk/legacy transitions) plus their family-only helpers, registered through six position-preserving calls sharing one memoized per-app family. The publication engine — manifest read/write/generation, publication readers, session read-state, recovery-snapshot hooks, spool/stage lifecycle, and stream-limit constants — stays in `server.cjs` and crosses via ctx; `dbEtag` mutations go through the server-side `ensurePluginStorageTransitionDbEtag()`/`publishPluginStorageTransitionDbState()` wrappers. |
| `server/node/plugin-storage/pluginStorageManifestCache.cjs` | Revision-bound parsed manifest cache. It reuses exact value/meta key membership and hashed-key mappings, prepares ordered deltas, and publishes a prepared cache entry only for the committed plugin-publication revision. |
| `server/node/plugin-storage/pluginSaveKeys.cjs` | Canonical optimized-plugin prefixes, manifest/folded markers, and lossless physical-key policy: UTF-8/base64url, tagged ill-formed UTF-16, or manifest-v3-mapped archive-safe hashes. |
| `server/node/plugin-storage/pluginStorageJson.cjs`, `pluginStorageLimits.cjs` | Strict and lossless plugin-row codecs, key/row validation, and authoritative per-value and aggregate optimized-storage limits. `lossless-json-v1` is distinguished by the `PRISUL01` frame magic; metadata remains strict-JSON-only. |
| `server/node/plugin-storage/pluginStorageViewerFacets.cjs` | Trigger-revisioned display-size and owner facets for plugin viewer paging. Live writes maintain current facets transactionally; pinned readers can reuse only an index matching the exact source revision, otherwise routes rebuild it. |

#### `runtime/`

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/runtime/session-lock.cjs` | In-memory single-writer authority. `register()` records a boot without stealing; `checkWrite()` distinguishes the active writer, fresh gesture-backed takeover, fresh passive compatibility writes, stale or boot-epoch rejection; `peek()` provides a side-effect-free foreground status. |
| `server/node/runtime/boundedSessionState.cjs` | Bounded LRU state for per-browser protocol pins. The server uses `createBoundedSessionState()` to retain at most 50 session-scoped plugin-publication read states independently of writer authority. |
| `server/node/runtime/buildStamp.cjs` | Loads and validates `dist/build-stamp.json` for writer-mutation admission. `readClientBuildStamp()` returns `null` and logs a warning on any read, parse, or shape failure, deliberately disabling the build check rather than blocking the server. |
| `server/node/runtime/platformFilesystem.cjs`, `portablePath.cjs` | Central platform capability boundaries: directory fsync classification, POSIX-only mode hardening, verified Windows publication retries, file-identity comparison, and reversible Windows-safe physical filename encoding. |
| `server/node/runtime/gracefulShutdown.cjs`, `archiveExtraction.cjs` | Idempotent multi-signal shutdown registration and shell-free update archive extraction. Windows ZIP extraction prefers argument-array `tar.exe` and falls back to encoded PowerShell `Expand-Archive`. |
| `server/node/runtime/model-jobs.cjs` | Durable upstream model relay. `createModelJobs()` stores non-secret job metadata in `save/model-jobs.db`, records exact provider response bytes in append-only journals under `save/model-jobs/`, tails running streams, supports claims, and owns 48-hour pending-send tombstones. Main jobs are recoverable; auxiliary pipeline requests are relay-only. |
| `server/node/runtime/logs.cjs` | Separate SQLite-backed client/server diagnostic log sink in `save/logs.db`. It masks credentials, batches writes, builds the server logger, installs fatal process handlers (accepting an `onFatalExit` callback that `server.cjs` wires to the emergency database flush), and records otherwise-unlogged Express errors. This is distinct from provider request history and usage in `request-logs.cjs`. |
| `server/node/runtime/request-logs.cjs` | Provider request history and token usage in `save/request-logs.db`. `createRequestLogs()` masks/truncates request material, rotates heavy request bodies by byte budget, retains the small usage ledger, exposes query/statistics routes, and closes independently at shutdown. |
| `server/node/runtime/request-trace.cjs` | Opt-in whole-exchange debug tracing. `createRequestTracer()` captures only completed non-streaming HTTP exchanges, writes atomic gzip files under `save/trace`, and retains the newest 500 without affecting request handling on trace failures. |
| `server/node/runtime/selfUpdate.cjs` | Public-stats, update-check, and portable self-update routes via `registerSelfUpdateRoutes(app, ctx)`. Owns deployment-type detection, release/asset resolution, and the in-process recovery-path state-lock tail (`withLocalRecoveryPathStateLock()`); exports `isSelfUpdateInProgress()` and the recovery-path test gate, which `backupRoutes.cjs` uses directly so backup-path changes and self-update serialize on one queue. |
| `server/node/runtime/proxy.cjs` | Reverse-proxy (`/proxy`, `/proxy2`), Hub proxy, and local proxy-stream-job routes via `registerProxyRoutes(app, ctx)`. Owns the job map/lifecycle, target sanitation for stream jobs, and the job WebSocket; exports `checkProxyAuth` (reused by model-jobs registration), `setupProxyStreamWebSocket(server)` (attached by both HTTP/HTTPS boot branches), and `startProxyStreamJobGc()` (called beside `backupRoutes.cjs`'s `startPartialExportJobGc()` in the boot IIFE). Target allow-policy itself stays in `runtime/proxyTarget.cjs`. |
| `server/node/runtime/observability.cjs` | Client/server log routes (`/api/logs`), `/api/storage/capacity`, and `/api/storage/list-sizes` through position-preserving `registerStorageCapacityRoute`/`registerStorageListSizesRoute`/`registerLogRoutes` calls. Thin wrappers over `runtime/logs.cjs` and `db/db.cjs`; auth, import-barrier access, and disk-space checks cross from `server.cjs` through ctx. |

#### Coverage anchors

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/node/backup/backupSnapshot.test.ts`, `test/compat/export-concurrent-mutation.test.ts` | Prove pinned snapshot reads survive live updates/deletes, missing referenced chats abort exports, concurrent plugin changes cannot corrupt archive framing, and completed exports re-import exactly. |
| `server/node/backup/importBarrier.test.ts`, `server/node/backup/importJournal.test.ts`, `test/compat/import-mutation-barrier.test.ts` | Cover hold-before-drain ordering, retryable mutation refusal, late import rollback, crash recovery for directory swaps, and list-epoch invalidation. |
| `server/node/plugin-storage/snapshotPluginStorage.e2e.test.ts`, `test/compat/snapshot-spool.test.ts` | Cover exact optimized-plugin recovery (including folded-empty/pre-marker cases), chunk-streamed snapshot writes, save-volume spooling, orphan cleanup, and non-fatal snapshot-only failures. |
| `server/node/chat/bufferedIngress.test.ts`, `server/node/runtime/session-lock.test.ts`, `server/node/runtime/model-jobs.test.ts`, `server/node/runtime/request-logs.test.ts` | Cover pre-parser admission/limits/concurrent byte accounting, writer registration/takeover/restart fencing, recoverable versus auxiliary job lifecycle and retention, journal streaming/security, pending sends, request masking/truncation/rotation, usage retention, route guards, and database closure. Real-server ingress ordering and abort release are covered by `test/compat/buffered-ingress-admission.test.ts`. |

### Hono scaffold

| File | Role and important symbols |
|---|---|
| `server/hono/src/app/index.ts` | Shared Hono application. It installs CSRF middleware and exposes only `GET /`, returning `Hello Hono!`; see `server/hono/src/app/index.ts:4`. |
| `server/hono/src/node.ts` | Node adapter with static serving from `./static`; hard-coded port 3000 at `server/hono/src/node.ts:7`. |
| `server/hono/src/bun.ts` | Bun adapter and `hono/bun` static middleware at `server/hono/src/bun.ts:1`. |
| `server/hono/src/cf.ts` | Exports the shared app for Cloudflare/Vercel, without storage or static middleware; see `server/hono/src/cf.ts:1`. |
| `server/hono/src/utils/postbuild.js` | Copies the root Vite `dist/` into Hono’s `static/` and Vercel output directories. It assumes execution from the repository root at `server/hono/src/utils/postbuild.js:3`. |
| `server/hono/package.json` | Separate Hono dependencies and Bun/Cloudflare/Node/Vercel scripts at `server/hono/package.json:4`. |
| `server/hono/tsconfig.json` | Strict NodeNext/ESNext TypeScript configuration with `hono/jsx`; see `server/hono/tsconfig.json:2`. |
| `server/hono/wrangler.jsonc` | Cloudflare name and static asset directory at `server/hono/wrangler.jsonc:1`. |
| `server/hono/README.md` | Explicitly marks the Hono tree as an incomplete, non-deployable scaffold and points to the production Node backend. |

## 3. Architecture & data flow

### Startup and configuration

1. `pnpm runserver` invokes `node server/node/server.cjs` from the repository root.
2. CommonJS evaluation loads `db.cjs` and `logs.cjs`; those modules synchronously
   create/open `risuai.db` and `logs.db`. Route initialization later creates the
   independent `model-jobs.db` and `request-logs.db` stores.
3. `db.cjs` creates `save/`, opens `save/risuai.db`, enables WAL with the power-loss-durable `synchronous=FULL` default, and applies performance and lock pragmas near `server/node/db/db.cjs:23`. It creates the `kv`, deletion-journal, epoch, and operational migration-state tables, initializes the chunk store, then attempts legacy save-folder migration. Legacy values and their `storage_migrations` completion row commit together; `.migrated_to_sqlite` is an atomically published rollback/UI compatibility marker that startup reconciles against that state. `server.cjs` may apply only an explicit persisted or administrator-managed downgrade after this safe startup boundary.
4. `server.cjs` installs fatal logging handlers before the rest of its initialization,
   then reads and validates `dist/build-stamp.json`. A valid stamp enables writer build
   admission and is logged; any read/parse/shape failure logs a warning and returns `null`,
   so build admission is fail-open. The server then creates `save/`, validates or atomically
   creates its analytics and separate spool-owner identities, completes the canonical-save-root
   claim/reseed before any owned-child operation, then either quarantines and descriptor-pins
   that spool owner's prior namespace for POSIX cleanup or creates a fresh retained-per-boot
   Windows runtime child, resolves the
   independent chat-history root, migrates legacy history from the configured
   server-backup directory, reads or creates the password/JWT files, loads
   persisted direct-asset sessions, initializes the server-backup directory, and registers
   middleware and routes.
5. `startServer()` resolves interrupted filesystem swaps, then read-only preflights the live database before any migration or epoch write. A valid database gets the epoch bump plus asset, inlay, chat, plugin-stage, and legacy `REMOTE` migrations. A corrupt database skips those mutations and listens in authenticated snapshot-recovery mode so the original bytes remain recoverable. The chat migration first writes `migration-backup/pre-chat-externalization-<timestamp>.bin`, then records `migration/chats-externalized`.
6. TLS is enabled only when both `server/node/ssl/certificate/server.key` and `server.crt` can be read; otherwise it starts plain HTTP.
7. Both HTTP and HTTPS servers install the proxy-job WebSocket upgrade handler before listening.
8. After listening, the server reconciles chat-version files, streaming each loose source
   into an independently compressed frame, migrating legacy solid bundles with bounded
   state, trimming the oldest versions beyond the count or per-chat uncompressed-byte cap,
   and enforcing the separate compressed-disk budget. Shutdown handlers flush debounced database writes, truncate-checkpoint WAL, and
   close the model-job and request-log databases. The durability scheduler runs verified
   one-minute checkpoints in balanced mode and five-minute checkpoints in performance
   mode, retries busy attempts, and retains five-minute truncate maintenance in durable
   mode; list-deletion records are pruned hourly.

The server reads configuration directly from `process.env`; it does not load `.env` itself:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | HTTP/HTTPS port; default `6001`. |
| `HOST` | Optional bind address passed to `server.listen()`; unset preserves the historical all-interfaces bind. Use `127.0.0.1` behind a local reverse proxy. |
| `POCKETRISU_CHUNK_THRESHOLD` | Lowers the protected-chunk threshold for every logical KV namespace. The effective maximum/default is 16 MiB. |
| `POCKETRISU_CHUNK_WORKERS` | Maximum admitted-write chunk-plan workers; default 2 and accepted range 1–4. Worker failures fall back to the existing synchronous file-source publication inside the mutation queue. |
| `POCKETRISU_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS` | Minimum interval between automatic DB snapshots; default five minutes. |
| `POCKETRISU_ASSET_GC_GRACE_MS` | Minimum time an ordinary asset must remain unreferenced across independent server sweeps before deletion; default seven days. |
| `POCKETRISU_ASSET_GC_START_DELAY_MS` | Delay before the first server-owned asset sweep; default 30 seconds. |
| `POCKETRISU_ASSET_GC_INTERVAL_MS` | Delay between later asset sweeps; default 24 hours and clamped to at least one second. |
| `POCKETRISU_ASSET_GC_AUTO` | Set to `0` to disable automatic sweeps or `1` to force-enable them in test environments. The authenticated `/api/assets/cleanup` maintenance endpoint remains available. |
| `POCKETRISU_ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTEXT` | Allows client boot outside HTTPS or localhost only when exactly `1` or `true`; bypasses the WebCrypto integrity gate at the operator's risk. |
| `TRACE_REQUEST_FOR_DEBUG` | When exactly `true`, enables whole-exchange debug traces and injects the frontend plugin-storage diagnostic flag. See [request logging and observability](#request-logging-and-observability). |
| `POCKETRISU_QUEUE_DIAG` | When exactly `true`, instruments the storage FIFO by operation label and registers authenticated `GET /api/debug/queue-diag`. It is off by default. |
| `POCKETRISU_HUB_HOSTING` | Enables shared/multi-instance hub hosting when set to `TRUE`/`true` or `1`. It hides host-disk statistics from `/api/db/stats`, disables the file-based server-backup feature with `403` responses, and pins the snapshot retention byte cap to `POCKETRISU_HUB_SNAPSHOT_CAP_MB` (only the snapshot count stays adjustable). |
| `POCKETRISU_HUB_SNAPSHOT_CAP_MB` | Hub-mode snapshot byte cap in MB, applied to both the limits endpoints and trim rotation; unset or invalid falls back to 500 MB, clamped to the 10 MB–50 GB safety bounds. Ignored outside hub mode. |
| `POCKETRISU_SQLITE_DURABILITY_MODE` | Administrator-managed SQLite durability policy: `durable`, `balanced`, or `performance`. Invalid values fail safe to `durable`. Any explicit value locks the System-dashboard control; hub mode is always administrator-managed and defaults to `durable` when unset. |
| `POCKETRISU_CHAT_BACKUP_DIR` | Overrides the final chat-history directory. Absolute paths are used directly; relative paths resolve from `process.cwd()`. The default is `<savePath>/chat-backups` (normally `save/chat-backups`, or `/app/save/chat-backups` in Docker). This operator setting also applies in hub mode and is independent of the server-file-backup path/API. |
| `POCKETRISU_CHAT_BACKUP_MAX_BYTES` | Overrides the global per-chat-history budget in bytes. Default 50 MiB; clamped to 1 MiB–50 GiB. It takes precedence over the `config/chat-backup-max-bytes` KV setting. |
| `POCKETRISU_CHAT_BACKUP_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES` | Overrides the per-chat retained uncompressed-byte cap. Default 256 MiB; clamped to 1 MiB–50 GiB. It takes precedence over `config/chat-backup-max-uncompressed-bytes`. The newest recovery point remains protected when it alone exceeds the cap. |
| `POCKETRISU_SPOOL_DIR` | Relocates the shared root for admitted ingress, database assembly, decoded stream loads, archive/import staging, plugin-value uploads, and snapshot-restore spools. Default `save/.spool`; those consumers use a stable `.instance-<sha256(__spool_owner_id)>/` namespace, so installations may share the configured root without sharing ownership. A private sibling claim binds that UUID to the canonical save root; a save-tree clone under a different path therefore deterministically reseeds its copied owner UUID before any child validation or cleanup. Identity repair and exclusive claim publication do not use a reclaimable lock pathname. Invalid or unsafe identity objects are regenerated or atomically parked without following symlinks. POSIX consumers use a process-lifetime pinned descriptor alias and boot reaps recognized families through pinned identities. Windows consumers use a unique `.runtime-*` child per process because Node has no equivalent safe directory-descriptor namespace; startup never recursively sweeps the stable pathname, and stale runtime children remain retained. Unowned legacy root files and other owner namespaces are preserved. This setting does not relocate filesystem export pins or plugin transition stages. |

### Authentication and writer authority

This subsection is the canonical server-side lock protocol. The Node backend uses
short-lived server-issued HMAC-SHA256 JWTs for ordinary API requests and a seven-day
opaque direct-session cookie for assets, flush/compress routes, and JWT renewal through
`/api/test_auth`. `/api/session` persists the cookie token, advertises database/plugin
capabilities, and registers the browser's optional `x-session-id` with the in-memory
`sessionLock`.

Registration does not steal an active writer. `checkActiveSession()` applies
`sessionLock.checkWrite()` at mutation time: the active session passes and refreshes its
write timestamp; a different session can take over only if it booted after the active
writer's last accepted write and sends recent-user-activity proof. A fresh passive write
is accepted without moving or refreshing the lock, preserving boot/keepalive
compatibility. A stale session receives HTTP 423, while clients that omit `x-session-id`
remain ownership-compatibility-exempt unless they present a stale epoch. `GET
/api/session/lock-status` calls side-effect-free `peek()` and never acquires authority.

`createSessionLock()` also generates a random 256-bit writer epoch at each server boot.
Every `/api/*` response exposes it as `x-writer-epoch`; `/api/session` and the lock-status
response include `writerEpoch`, and epoch-aware clients echo it on later requests. A
client presenting a non-empty epoch from an earlier boot is stale even though the
in-memory active-writer map reset, so its mutation receives HTTP 423
`SESSION_DEACTIVATED`. Omitting the epoch preserves the legacy restart gap: the first
registration or write after restart can become active.

Session-scoped plugin read pins are separate from that writer lock.
`pluginStorageReadStateBySession` uses `createBoundedSessionState()` as a 50-entry LRU;
reads refresh the session's entry and churn evicts the oldest boot ID, bounding this
per-browser compatibility state without changing mutation authority.

Buffered JSON, `application/octet-stream`, and plain-text requests pass through
`bufferedIngress.cjs` before Express reads their bodies. Protected routes authenticate
first. The retired direct plugin-transition protocol is then rejected at admission;
otherwise, when `expectedClientBuild` was loaded from `dist/build-stamp.json`, every
writer mutation must present the exact `x-client-build` stamp. A missing or mismatched
stamp returns HTTP 426 `CLIENT_UPGRADE_REQUIRED` with a definitive not-committed outcome
before body reservation or parsing. Retired-protocol requests receive that same 426 even
when stamp loading failed open. Writer routes next use side-effect-free
`sessionLock.peek()` to refuse stale clients. Admission requires an identity-encoded,
exact `Content-Length`, applies the route ceiling, and reserves those bytes from the
global budget until `finish` or `close`. Budget pressure returns retryable HTTP 503 with
a definitive not-committed outcome. The mutation route still calls
`checkActiveSession()` after parsing, so only that authoritative check may refresh or
transfer writer ownership. Bodyless and direct-stream writer protocols pass through the
identity/build/session checks but retain their own body bounds and bypass the
buffered-body ledger.

After that admission, raw `/api/write` bodies and raw/JSON chat POST bodies are consumed
into `0600`, create-only files under the installation-owned child of
`POCKETRISU_SPOOL_DIR` in at most 64 KiB pages;
Express never constructs their payload-sized request `Buffer`. The exact admission
reservation remains charged until response `finish`/`close`, even when route cleanup
unlinks the spool earlier, so disk spooling does not increase concurrent admitted bytes.
Disk-full, quota, or unavailable spool-volume failures use the same retryable
`BUFFERED_INGRESS_BUSY` refusal. Validation and worker preparation happen before queue
entry, but the private file has no publication authority: import fencing, ETag and plugin
publication guards, prior database state, and chat pre-images are re-read or captured
inside `queueStorageMutation()` immediately before the transactional publication.

Each `<id-hex-chunks>` or `<ext-hex-chunks>` placeholder is one or more lowercase-hex
UTF-8 path components, each at most 120 characters. Payload and sidecar leaves are
therefore disjoint even for hostile IDs/extensions; root-level legacy files are not
current publication targets.

`risuai.db` contains:

- `kv(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value BLOB, updated_at INTEGER)`, with a covering
  `(updated_at, key)` delta-list index, created at `server/node/db/db.cjs:29`.
- `deleted_keys(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, deleted_at INTEGER)`, a seven-day deletion journal used by delta key listings.
- `sync_meta(id = 1, list_epoch TEXT)`, whose random epoch invalidates incompatible browser list caches.
- `chunks(hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY, data BLOB)`, created at `server/node/db/chunkStore.cjs:117-121`.
- `manifest_chunks(manifest_key, seq, hash)`, mapping logical values to ordered chunks at `server/node/db/chunkStore.cjs:122-128`.
- `chunk_manifest_meta`, `chunk_manifest_protection`, and
  `chunk_manifest_publications`, which bind marker rows to complete chunk counts,
  logical length, and whole-value SHA-256 before readers accept them.
- `chunk_manifest_inventory_revision`, whose per-publication trigger-backed source and
  verified revisions allow size-only reads to use `logical_size` after one authoritative
  manifest/chunk inventory derivation. Missing or stale verification falls back to the
  grouped derivation and corruption remains fail-closed. Its separate
  `content_verified_revision` binds exact stored-byte verification to the same source
  revision without weakening the inventory proof; a process-local revision memo is also
  required before content hashing may be skipped.
- `plugin_storage_usage` and `plugin_storage_owners`, derived indexes for optimized
  storage quota and ownership accounting.
- `replacement_operations`, the transaction-bound committed/not-committed status used to
  reconcile destructive requests whose acknowledgement was lost.
- `chat_row_metadata`, the per-row logical publication keyed by encoded chat-row identity.
  A random mutation token binds the materialized-row SHA-256, materialized byte length,
  cold-storage state, message count, log capability, and current log count/bytes. KV
  triggers clear logs and invalidate metadata on every direct full-row write/delete;
  legacy gaps are repaired lazily rather than through a boot-time scan.
- `chat_row_operations`, the authoritative ordered extension for a chat base row. Each
  `(row_key, sequence)` entry records the self-describing
  `pocketrisu-chat-operation-v1` format, `application/json-patch+json` media type,
  base/result SHA-256 commitments, result size, and bounded normalized patch JSON.
  Existing `chats/*` rows are already valid base rows with empty logs; no data migration
  is required.
- `storage_migrations`, the authoritative completion/version record for legacy save-folder
  ingestion; `.migrated_to_sqlite` is only its filesystem compatibility marker.
- Possibly orphaned historical entity tables (`characters`, `chats`, `settings`, `presets`, `modules`); new installations do not create or use them, as documented at `server/node/db/db.cjs:51-54`.

Important KV namespaces include:

- `database/database.bin`: canonical stubs-only database save; chat bodies are not stored inline.
- `chats/<encodeURIComponent(chaId)>/<encodeURIComponent(chatId)>`: one legacy-encoded
  base chat body per row, optionally followed logically by `chat_row_operations`; every
  public reader sees the exact materialized legacy row. Managed by `server/node/chat/chatRows.cjs`.
- `pluginsave/<physicalName>`: one codec-discriminated optimized plugin VALUE row per key.
  `json-v1` is unframed UTF-8 strict JSON; `lossless-json-v1` starts with ASCII
  `PRISUL01` and carries a tagged JSON payload that preserves values such as `undefined`
  and array holes during recovery. A physical name is `<base64url>.json` for a
  well-formed raw key,
  `utf16-v1.<base64url-code-units>.json` for an ill-formed JavaScript string, or
  `sha256-v1.<64-hex>.json` when the prefixed name would exceed the 1,024-byte archive
  limit.
- `pluginsave-meta/<physicalName>`: matching optimized plugin METADATA/ownership rows
  using the same physical name. These rows must use strict `json-v1`; lossless framing is
  invalid metadata.
- `plugin-storage/manifest.json`: exact generation-bound value/metadata key set; manifest
  v3 supplies the raw-key mappings required by every hashed physical component.
- `database/dbbackup-<timestamp/100>.bin`: full, assembled DB-only automatic snapshots,
  created by `createBackupAndRotate()`.
- `assets/`: binary application assets.
- `remotes/`: retained upstream `REMOTE`-block payloads.
- `coldstorage/`: gzipped upstream cold-storage JSON.
- `inlay_meta/`: inlay metadata still kept in KV.
- `drafts/<chaId>/<chatId>`: unsent per-chat composer text and timestamp, independent of
  the chat body.
- `config/`: snapshot limits, backup path, boot-reminder settings, and the optional chat-history compressed-disk and per-chat uncompressed-byte budgets.
- `config/plugin-storage-recovery-dirty`: durable token scheduling recovery capture after
  plugin-only atomic publications.
- `import_journal/marker`: transaction-side half of the filesystem import journal; present only while a staged asset/inlay directory publication may require startup recovery.
- `migration/disable-remote-saving`: idempotence marker for remote-block conversion.
- `migration/chats-externalized`: idempotence marker for the chat-row boot migration.
- `migration-backup/pre-chat-externalization-<timestamp>.bin`: manifest-safe copy of the pre-migration monolith for downgrade recovery.

`kvSet()` and `kvSetFromFile()` route every string key through the chunk store. Values at
or below the effective threshold remain ordinary KV rows. Larger values publish a marker
only with a protected, complete manifest; readers verify chunk hashes, sequence/count,
logical size, and whole-value SHA-256. This namespace-independent rule ensures that an
extension-defined row accepted by the generic API remains restorable from a save folder.

Chunks use deterministic FastCDC-style boundaries: minimum 4 KiB, maximum 64 KiB, approximately 16 KiB average, and SHA-256 content hashes at `server/node/db/chunkStore.cjs:18`. Values larger than 16 MiB are represented in `kv.value` by `CHUNK_MARKER`; reads concatenate manifest chunks through the bound store created at `server/node/db/chunkStore.cjs:114`.

For admitted file-source writes, bounded workers produce the FastCDC plan and per-chunk
and whole-value digests outside the event loop. The logical digest is advanced from each
chunk during that same scan; there is no second full-value sweep. Publication remains a
single SQLite transaction and revalidates the private file identity plus exact bytes of
any deduplicated chunk before installing the protected manifest. Worker creation,
execution, or result failure logs a degradation and uses the pre-existing synchronous
`kvSetFromFile()` chunker; the mutation is never dropped or published from a partial
plan.

### Main persistence flow

#### Initial database load

- `bootstrap.loadData()` rejects insecure non-local browser contexts unless the server injected the explicit bypass, initializes `AutoStorage`, then calls `readDatabaseForBoot()` at `src/ts/bootstrap.ts:126`.
- `AutoStorage` always selects `NodeStorage` at `src/ts/storage/autoStorage.ts:35`.
- `/api/session` advertises `database.rawBootRead` and `database.atomicCreate`. Current clients use the raw boot endpoint when the first capability is present; an older server with no capability response falls back to authenticated `GET /api/read` and confirms an empty response against an uncached `GET /api/list` before classifying the database as missing.
- With the browser resource cache disabled, a capable server uses
  `GET /api/db/read-raw-for-boot`. With it enabled, `/api/session` advertises the raw KV row
  byte length; the client bypasses cache inventory work below 128 KiB and otherwise verifies
  resident IndexedDB segments, advertises up to 8,192 hashes grouped as
  root/characters/botPresets/modules/personas, and calls `POST /api/db/read-cached`. An absent
  or invalid size hint preserves the cached path for compatibility with older servers. The raw
  route waits for the import barrier, returns verbatim bytes plus their raw MD5 for
  recovery, uses HTTP 204 only for explicit absence, and never uses a route-ambiguous 404.
- The cached-read endpoint flushes pending writes, prepares the same normalized stubs-only
  view and canonical legacy-view MD5 as `/api/read`, MessagePack-encodes each group member
  separately, and returns `{hash}` for advertised hits or `{bytes}` for misses. Any
  malformed envelope, missing/corrupt local entry, unadvertised hit, or ETag disagreement
  makes a capable client retry the raw boot read. Unlike the ordinary and raw database
  routes, this route currently does not call `importBarrier.waitUntilIdle()` before
  reading, so it does not itself fence a concurrently open destructive-import transaction.
- Fresh initialization calls `POST /api/db/create-if-absent`, not generic replacement. The
  route ignores client-provided database bytes, runs behind the writer-session check and
  serialized storage mutation queue, and creates the canonical legacy-encoded `{}` in a
  SQLite transaction only if the live key is absent. It returns 201 plus the committed
  ETag to the winner and a definitive 409 without mutation to losing concurrent creators;
  a losing bootstrap rereads the winner's database.
- `/api/read` and `/api/db/read-cached` serialize pending-patch flush plus live-row selection through the storage FIFO. They reuse the stubs-only decoded graph only when its trigger-backed SQLite row revision still matches, otherwise they decode, normalize, and replace the clean cache entry. `/api/read` sends the legacy-encoded stripped database plus `x-db-etag`; if a full chat payload or folded optimized plugin storage leaked into the live row, defensive `ingestDatabase()` recovery advances the revision and the selector retries. Clean entries are bounded by entry count, estimated bytes, per-entry size, and V8 heap pressure; dirty acknowledged patch entries are never evicted.
- `/api/db/stats/characters` and `/api/db/stats/modules` call the same
  `prepareLiveDatabaseRead()` selector with full-blob encoding disabled. They therefore
  reuse a decoded graph only at the exact live `database.bin` revision and repopulate the
  bounded cache on a miss instead of independently decoding the row for each dashboard
  request.
- `POST /api/plugin-storage/reconcile-boot` derives the selected row's raw MD5 and, when
  needed, its canonical normalized legacy-view MD5 inside one queued storage operation.
  Cache-off and segmented boots may therefore present different but equivalent tokens;
  either is accepted only for that row, and `dbEtag` retains the accepted token domain.
  A truly stale token returns `PLUGIN_STORAGE_BOOT_CONFLICT`. If reconciliation removes
  recovered inline copies, it returns the changed database ETag so bootstrap rereads the
  paired row and token.
- `GET /api/plugin-storage/recovery` exposes only encoded-key issue metadata and
  proof-bound action availability. Its download route streams an exact privately spooled
  affected row with SHA-256, while writer-fenced `POST .../resolve` atomically adopts a
  valid inline copy or deletes an unrecoverable row with its manifest/owner/quota state.
  Every action rescans the live publication and rejects a stale opaque token before
  mutation; response envelopes exclude decoded keys, values, and exception text.
  Recovery canonicalization accepts either codec for VALUE rows and falls back to
  `lossless-json-v1` when an inline value cannot be represented by strict JSON, but it
  rejects lossless METADATA rows so owner state remains strict JSON.
- Staged transition downloads call `openStageRowDownload()` to validate size and create a
  stream from one already-open read-only descriptor. Validation and delivery therefore
  cannot observe two different row files through a size-check-then-reopen race.
- Monolith-shaped inputs from boot migration, backup/snapshot restore, save-folder import, or defensive route recovery pass through `ingestDatabase()`. Supported raw or gzip/zlib MessagePack inputs above `RISU_STREAM_INGEST_MIN_BYTES` route to `ingestStreamingDatabase()`: the walker retains byte offsets for the root and character fields, decodes one chat at a time, and writes chat rows plus the stripped DB in one transaction without constructing or persisting the full monolith. Missing-ID assignment, duplicate handling, orphan-folder normalization, stub projection, cold-storage restoration, stale-row sweeping, and optimized plugin splitting share the same semantics as `ingestFullDatabase()`. Legacy block saves, bare deflate/JSON fallbacks, and unsupported compressed payloads retain the in-memory decoder.
- Before either monolith-ingest path finalizes chat rows and the stripped database,
  `chatRows.cjs` calls `applyDatabaseCharacterDefaults()` from
  `chat/characterDefaults.cjs`, applying `shared/character-defaults-policy.json` to
  missing character fields and character/persona/preset IDs. The policy semantics are
  owned by [presets and profiles](presets-profiles.md).
- The HTML root injects `globalThis.__NODE__`, `globalThis.__PATCH_SYNC__`, and
  `globalThis.__ALLOW_INSECURE_CONTEXT__`; it also sets
  `globalThis.__PLUGIN_STORAGE_DIAG__` from the debug-tracing gate. `src/ts/platform.ts`
  consumes the platform/security flags, while plugin-storage diagnostics read their
  dedicated global directly.

#### Patch save and full-write fallback

- `persistTrackedChanges()` first stages changed full chats individually, then encodes `database.bin` with chat stubs at `src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:769-813`.
- When patch sync is enabled, it calls `NodeStorage.patchItem()` through `forageStorage` at `src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:980`.
- `/api/patch` loads or reuses the stripped `dbCache` only at the exact current database-row revision, checks the client’s compositional hash, validates chat paths, applies RFC 6902 operations to a clone, externalizes any whole-chat payload operations, records old-minus-new chat rows for deferred deletion, and updates the stripped-view ETag. A structural patch — one whose referenced chat-row key set changed in either direction — persists inside the request before acknowledging and reports `durable: true`, so a new chat's stub can never be lost while its synchronously written row survives; metadata-only patches schedule persistence after five seconds and report `durable: false` (a staged acknowledgement the client retains dirty state for until a flush confirmation). A failed structural persist still acknowledges, with `durable: false` plus the `persistWarning` surface. Manifest/external-row patches and database patches touching plugin mode, generation, folded markers, or optimized value/owner maps are rejected with `PLUGIN_STORAGE_PUBLICATION_GUARD`. The original inline behavior is retained only when the server proves that the live authoritative mode is inline; those database patches may update `pluginCustomStorage` and `pluginStorageMeta` through the ordinary delayed path.
- The timer calls `persistDbCache()`, which verifies the cache's base revision before encoding and again inside the commit transaction, then commits the stubs-only database and queued chat-row deletions together. A failed stub write therefore cannot leave its former chat rows already deleted, and an external database-row change cannot be overwritten by an acknowledged stale patch cache. Successful persistence binds the retained clean graph to the newly committed revision.
- Patch hash mismatches return `DATABASE_PATCH_CONFLICT`; the frontend keeps the response ETag provisional, reads and installs the matching authoritative database, and retries a patch from that baseline. Non-conflict rejections such as the chat guard may fall back to an ETag-guarded `NodeStorage.setItem()`/`/api/write`, while patch-enabled clients refuse unversioned full writes (`src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:965-1025`).
- `/api/write` spools and validates its admitted bytes before queue entry, then checks the stripped-view ETag and the live selected plugin publication after queue admission. It derives prior chat deletions from the then-current database, captures their required pre-images, and commits staged external chat rows/plugin rows, `database.bin`, and targeted chat deletion in one SQLite transaction. A mutation that wins between validation and publication therefore produces the same ETag/plugin refusal as the buffered path. Plugin mode/generation changes use the specialized CAS/batch/transition protocols.
- Ordinary request-time mutations run through the promise-based
  `queueStorageOperation()` FIFO, wrapped by `queueStorageMutation()`. An import claims the
  barrier first and then drains that FIFO: mutations already queued ahead of the drain
  commit before the import's `BEGIN`, while later mutations see the hold and are refused
  with `503 IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS` plus `Retry-After` instead of joining (and then being
  rolled back with) the import transaction. Outside the import owner's already-exclusive
  transaction, KV/chat-row/asset writes must use `queueStorageMutation()`, never
  `queueStorageOperation()` directly.
- With `POCKETRISU_QUEUE_DIAG=true`, the same FIFO records per-label operation counts,
  total and maximum queue wait/hold milliseconds, and a bounded 512-operation reservoir
  sample used for wait/hold p50 and p95. Authenticated `GET /api/debug/queue-diag`
  returns the snapshot, and graceful `SIGTERM` prints the per-label summary. The route and
  timing overhead do not exist when the gate is off.

#### Hash-verified resource cache and key-list reads

- This is the server counterpart of the disposable verified browser cache documented in
  [client storage](client-storage.md). When that cache is enabled, ordinary non-database
  KV reads and chat-row reads advertise locally resident SHA-256 values in
  `x-cached-hashes`. `/api/read` and the chat endpoint return `204` plus
  `x-content-hash` on a match; otherwise they return authoritative bytes. The browser
  re-hashes cached bytes before decoding and retries without the cache header on any
  inconsistency.
- `/api/write` and the chat POST return the authoritative content hash so successful client writes can seed the disposable cache without downloading the same bytes again.
- `GET /api/list` waits for the import barrier to become idle, then supports full and delta responses. `NodeStorage.keys()` caches each prefix's key set, timestamp, and server epoch in a small separate IndexedDB database; a valid delta merges `added`/`deleted`, while missing, stale (older than six days), future-dated, or epoch-mismatched state receives a full list.
- SQLite `updated_at`, the `deleted_keys` journal, filesystem asset/inlay mtimes, and
  `sync_meta.list_epoch` are the protocol sources. A valid server boot rotates the epoch;
  destructive replacement commit and rollback paths rotate it around publication as
  applicable. Corrupt-boot recovery performs no preflight mutation. A missing or
  mismatched epoch forces a full response, and deletion records are retained for seven
  days and cleaned at boot plus hourly.
- KV delta selection is covered by `(updated_at, key)`. Inlay deltas retain the
  authoritative per-file mtime scan only up to 1,024 payloads; larger directories return
  a full authoritative key set with the same epoch/timestamp schema, bounding filesystem
  stats without adding a second journal to the sidecar/import commit protocol.

#### Externalized chat content

- `createChatRowStore()` is constructed once against the real SQLite-backed KV functions.
  Runtime chat bodies are never retained in a server-wide in-memory map.
- `GET /api/chat-content/:chaId/:chatIndex` resolves the `x-chat-id` row directly when
  supplied, otherwise falls back through the stripped database's index and rejects an ID
  mismatch with 409. The index fallback first reuses the exact-revision decoded database
  cache (including current acknowledged dirty state); on a cache miss it flushes pending
  state and calls `prepareLiveDatabaseRead()` with full-blob encoding disabled. A log-free
  warm row remains one protected raw read. A row with a log
  replays its bounded whole-message operations on demand, legacy-encodes once, and verifies
  the exact materialized SHA-256/length against `chat_row_metadata`; the 64-operation or
  1 MiB defaults bound this work until queued compaction. Async protected reads bind base
  selection to `row_token` and retry if a checkpoint wins across the await.
  Missing or hash-mismatched metadata decodes the same selection and conditionally repairs
  it by mutation token.
  Cold rows are rehydrated from that selection and cache-filled only when the row is still
  unchanged and no import owns the mutation barrier. The route supports verified `204`
  cache hits and otherwise returns the historical raw/canonical response bytes.
- A full `POST /api/chat-content/:chaId/:chatIndex` spools and validates binary or JSON input
  before queue entry and publishes the staged encoded row inside `queueStorageMutation()`.
  Immediately before overwrite it asks
  `chatBackups.cjs` to stream the exact old raw row from protected chunk storage into the
  unchanged loose-version format, optionally tagged by `x-chat-backup-reason`; capture is
  best-effort and never blocks the authoritative save. The route requires `x-chat-id`,
  rejects bare stubs, heals hybrid `_stub` payloads, and returns the digest computed during
  the staged row's chunk-plan pass without
  a committed-row reread. It schedules the coalesced automatic snapshot only after
  acknowledging the row and never joins the five-second database debounce. During active
  generation the client row stage writes the first eligible dirty save, throttles later
  checkpoints to 20 seconds, and always queues a final idle save.
- Full-row writes with an acknowledged base carry `x-chat-base-hash`. Immediately before
  either the spooled or buffered publication, the server compares it with the current
  materialized row digest; a mismatch returns HTTP 409 `CHAT_ROW_BASE_MISMATCH` with a
  definitive not-committed outcome. Omitting the header remains legacy-compatible. This
  full-row precondition is separate from the operation log's base/result commitments
  described below.
- The same route accepts `application/vnd.pocketrisu.chat-delta+json` without the full-row
  spool. Its exact v1 schema is `{version, baseHash, resultHash, resultSize, patch}`. The
  normalized patch is non-empty, at most 1,024 operations and just under the existing
  32 MiB `/api/patch` admission bound, and may only replace an existing whole
  `/message/<index>` or append at `/message/-`. The server requires a warm canonical base,
  exact current base hash, consistent log chain, and legal result size. Refusals are
  definitive `CHAT_DELTA_*` envelopes with `commitOutcome: "not-committed"`; it never
  approximates an unsupported delta.
- Append commits the operation entry, materialized digest/size/message count, log totals,
  and a new `row_token` in one SQLite transaction. At 64 entries or 1 MiB of stored patch
  JSON, a deduplicated background storage-queue task materializes and rewrites the base,
  atomically clears applied entries through the KV triggers, and republishes identical
  logical metadata. The defaults avoid rewriting an ordinary generation after only a few
  checkpoints while bounding replay to a small operation loop and at most 1 MiB of patch
  input. A crash/failpoint anywhere in that transaction rolls back to the readable old
  base+log pair.
- Frontend placeholders are hydrated through `fetchChatFromServer()` and
  `ensureChatHydrated()` in `src/ts/storage/chatStorage.ts`.
- Metadata fields retained in stubs are exactly `id`, `name`, `_stub`, `lastDate`,
  `folderId`, and `modules`; keep `STUB_METADATA_FIELDS`, shared `chatRows.cjs`
  stub/overlay semantics, and the matching client projection synchronized.

#### Assets and inlays

- Ordinary assets are filesystem files in `save/assets/` when the key's basename is a safe filename (`server/node/assets/assetStore.cjs`); unsafe names stay as raw `assets/*` KV rows, and so do names the portable-identity preflight rejects — Windows-reserved basenames, trailing dots, and groups that collide under `portableAssetNameKey()` case folding (the startup migration skips every member of a colliding group; backup/save-folder imports demote an already-staged file when a colliding entry arrives). Reads/lists/stats/backups merge both sources. Writes are fsynced temp-file + rename (never in place — files may be hardlinked across instances by `scripts/dedup-assets.sh`). For ordinary and spooled writes, filesystem eligibility/case-collision admission, legacy-marker changes, payload publication, and KV shadow cleanup run under one stable sibling `save/__asset_maintenance.lock` ownership scope. That lock also serializes deletes, import swaps and journal recovery, and external dedup without moving with `assets/`; imports retain ownership until journal-aware finalization or rollback succeeds, and a failed in-process or live pending-journal recovery keeps the live token so runtime writes and external dedup fail closed until restart recovery. Runtime, recovery, and dedup canonicalize ancestor symlinks to the same asset identity, but reject a symlinked `assets` leaf because swapping it would change that identity. Owner metadata is completed and fsynced in a unique private staging inode before atomic hard-link publication at `owner.json`, so a pre-identity failure cannot expose an empty live owner. Failed publication cleanup requires both the exact created inode and a complete matching-token owner record; in-place corruption and copied-token replacement inodes are preserved fail-closed. Same-host creator/PID-labelled stages are removed only after their creator is inactive. Stale recovery atomically publishes one complete fixed-name intent to elect a remover, then revalidates the observed token and inode immediately before unlink; intent reconciliation never deletes owner state. Recovery/dedup cleanup retains the primary error while attempting same-owner releases. The dedup worker rejects blank operands, every existing non-directory, and targets not named `assets`; only a missing path lexically ending in `assets` is ignored for documented unmatched-glob compatibility. It locks every canonical target in locale-independent UTF-8 byte order, then requires one UID/GID across all targets and candidate files, one `stat.mode & 0o7777` value for target directories, and one for regular-file candidates; candidate ownership must match its containing directory. Metadata mismatch fails before interrupted-temp recovery or publication. It excludes hidden server/tool names, recovers its interrupted temps, byte-compares duplicates, then publishes link-to-temp with final inode/content/metadata revalidation, atomic rename, and directory fsync. Same-host dead owners are recoverable; live and foreign-host ownership fails closed, while malformed metadata requires verified operator cleanup of the exact owner file. A same-size destination is skipped only after byte comparison, so migration and a valid re-upload repair equal-length corruption. Uploads whose name matches `assets/<64-hex>.<ext>` are SHA-256-verified on `/api/write` and `/api/assets/bulk-write`. Historical mismatches accepted by main are explicitly marked under `save/assets/.legacy-hash-assets/`; only marked keys may retain mismatched bytes, and writing canonical bytes clears the exemption. Backup/save-folder imports classify mismatches during staging, while a bounded one-time scan (`.legacy_hash_identity_v1`) backfills files migrated by older builds. The original safe-row migration marker remains `save/assets/.migrated_to_fs`.
- `/api/assets/bulk-write` rejects malformed entries, every duplicate key, hash mismatch,
  invalid reserved plugin row/key/payload, and protected plugin/database namespace before
  the first mutation. Because legacy hash exemptions are state-dependent, it revalidates
  them after acquiring its one storage-queue/import-barrier slot. It then commits each
  ordered entry as an independent idempotent set. Its acknowledgement is `{results}`
  rather than batch success/failure: every input index is `committed`, `not-committed`, or
  `unknown`. If a filesystem or SQLite boundary throws, the server rereads that key's
  authoritative filesystem/KV value and reports the reconciled durable outcome; only an
  unreadable value remains `unknown`. For hash-shaped assets, the legacy-exemption marker
  is part of that authoritative invariant: canonical bytes with a retained marker are
  `not-committed` and safely retryable. The SQLite shadow-row/deletion-journal cleanup is
  auxiliary after a durable file rename—reads, listings, exports, and restart prefer the
  file—so rollback of that cleanup does not contradict `committed`.
- `NodeStorage.setItems()` keeps requests below both 20 entries and 90 MiB of JSON, maps
  each response back to global input indexes, and returns the aggregate outcomes. A later
  request failure throws `BulkWriteError` with the full known prefix, per-entry `unknown`
  statuses for an acknowledgement-lost request, and `not-committed` statuses for entries
  never dispatched. Its acknowledgement parser requires the exact response/result schema;
  malformed, reordered, incomplete, contradictory, or body-lost responses remain
  `COMMIT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` instead of collapsing prior outcomes into generic failure.
- `migrateInlaysToFilesystem()` converts legacy `inlay/*` KV JSON and canonicalizes any
  root-level `save/inlays/<id>.<ext>` plus `<id>.meta.json` compatibility inputs into the
  versioned `.inlay-objects-v1` payload/sidecar namespace. New `writeInlayFile()` and
  `writeInlayFileFromFile()` publications target only that namespace; startup first runs
  `reconcileInterruptedInlayPublications()` and canonicalizes leftover flat inputs.
- Inlay writes stage and fsync both payload and sidecar, atomically rename and
  directory-sync the canonical payload first, then publish the canonical sidecar as the
  extension-change commit point. Only afterward may they remove the old-extension payload
  or legacy flat inputs. A pre-commit failure rolls back the newly exposed extension while
  the old sidecar remains authoritative; startup removes recognized temporary files before
  migration resumes.
- Legacy key/value APIs synthesize the old JSON payload through
  `readInlayAssetPayload()`.
- `POST /api/inlays/delete-unreferenced` accepts at most 1,000 safe IDs (and at most
  1,000 client-protected IDs), then rescans every authoritative physical chat row and
  strictly inventories every retained chat pre-image inside the storage queue. The
  history proof covers loose, gzip, frame, and legacy-bundle versions across active and
  federated roots; unreadable directories, recognized malformed representations,
  disappearing candidates, unavailable known roots, inaccessible reserved conflict
  containers, and disappearance of an already discovered protected conflict namespace
  fail closed. Public history list/restore keeps its permissive discovery behavior. It removes
  filesystem and legacy KV representations only for IDs that are neither referenced nor
  client-protected; generic single-inlay removal applies the same guard.
- `GET /api/asset/:hexKey` serves assets with a cookie-authenticated direct URL, MIME
  detection, immutable caching, and `updated_at` or filesystem-mtime ETags.
- Inlay thumbnails are generated on demand with `wasm-vips`; bulk WebP conversion is
  exposed through the `/api/inlays/compress` SSE route.
- `getFileSrc()` switches Node deployments to direct asset URLs at `src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:113`.

#### Backup and migration flow

- Full and server-file exports require a valid live database and every referenced chat.
  They bind one read-only WAL snapshot to verified private filesystem copies before any
  archive is published. Missing chats fail closed.
- Partial export is a cancellable server job with selected assets and a recovery-oriented
  missing-chat policy. It is not assembled from browser memory.
- Destructive import implementations are split across `importBackupFromSource()`,
  `importSpool.cjs`, `importBarrier.cjs`, and `importJournal.cjs`: they provide bounded
  private ingress, exclusive mutation admission, and the SQLite/filesystem publication
  bridge. The complete barrier and outcome protocol is canonical in
  [backup and recovery](backup-recovery.md).
- Automatic snapshots briefly hold the storage queue to flush pending database state,
  pin one WAL snapshot, and capture a global token over database and chat revisions, the
  selected plugin publication/manifest, plugin quota/owner facets, and recovery-dirty
  state. Source-to-source assembly then runs outside the queue using only the pin. A
  second queued phase publishes and rotates only if the full token still matches;
  otherwise it discards and retries. They fold the selected plugin generation, preserve
  already-missing chats as bare stubs, and publish non-fatally into chunk-aware KV
  storage. Snapshot restore is bounded by decoded-size and disk-headroom limits,
  cancellable before commit, and atomic; its client wait is activity-based rather than a
  fixed total deadline.
- Destructive routes distinguish committed, not-committed, and unknown outcomes. An
  interrupted save-folder/snapshot response first consults the durable replacement status;
  any still-unknown result is reconciled by reload/readback and never replayed automatically.
- Per-chat pre-image history is a separate filesystem recovery mechanism and is not
  embedded in portable/server archives.

The framing, point-in-time cut, partial-job, import, snapshot, limits, cancellation, and
outcome contracts are canonical in [Backup and recovery](backup-recovery.md).

### Durable model requests and recovery

`createModelJobs()` is a recorder/relay for model-preset requests, not a second model
parser. It sends the upstream request, streams the provider bytes unchanged, and appends
the same bytes to `save/model-jobs/<jobId>.journal`. The SQLite row stores chat/generation,
adapter, status, timing, byte count, and only the target origin plus path. The schema has a
nullable `model` column, but `registerRoutes()` does not pass `req.body.model` to
`createJob()`, so route-created jobs do not populate it. Target query strings, request
headers, request bodies, and credentials remain in memory. Main jobs participate in chat
recovery and the per-chat running-job guard; auxiliary pipeline jobs use the reconnectable
relay but never appear in recovery lists.

Client job selection, adapter decoding, and retry behavior are documented in
[model providers](model-providers.md#durable-server-side-generation).

Active and unclaimed-main listings let `jobRecovery.ts` install a background per-chat
guard for running jobs and poll their status with a 3-to-15-second backoff. It reads and
decodes the journal only after the job becomes terminal; recovery does not reattach a live
stream or render partial bytes. A process restart marks formerly running jobs failed
because their upstream connection and memory-only credentials cannot be resumed. Recovery
saves the resulting external chat row before recording provider request usage and
claiming the job; a row failure leaves it unclaimed. Claimed and auxiliary terminal jobs
expire after seven days. Unclaimed main jobs are protected from age expiry but still
share the 50-terminal-record cap. Pending-send rows are atomic, per-chat one-shot recovery
markers and expire after 48 hours.

### Request logging and observability

Generic provider request capture is client-produced but server-persisted and enabled by
default. Tagged provider calls enter this path; unrelated asset, polling, and untagged
plugin traffic does not. Classic calls use `globalFetch()` or a scoped `fetchNative()`;
ModelPreset creates one `createRequestLogScope()` around the selected direct,
`/proxy2`/WebSocket-proxy, or durable `job` transport. Scoped text responses are teed
without consuming the provider branch, inline base64 media is stripped, and the batch
waits for adapter usage. The legacy `globalFetch()` JSON recorder is the documented
inline-media-redaction exception. The server's `createRequestLogs()` accepts
authenticated batches at `/api/request-logs`, normalizes the `direct`/`proxy`/`job` route
label, and masks credentials in URLs, headers, request/response bodies, and errors before
writing `save/request-logs.db`. Provider wire usage parsing remains documented in
[model providers](model-providers.md#request-logging-and-usage).

The `requests` table rotates toward a 256 MiB captured-body budget while retaining at
least 50 recent rows; request/response bodies are capped at 2 MiB, headers at 16 KiB, and
ingest batches at 50. The compact LLM-only `usage` row is written in the same transaction
but is not rotated, so statistics survive deletion of heavy bodies. Authenticated list,
detail, usage, and storage-stat routes expose the data; clearing request history is
writer-guarded and deletes usage only when explicitly requested. This database is
independent of both portable `.bin` exports and the bounded application diagnostic log
in `save/logs.db`.

Recovered durable jobs order their side effects deliberately: the client first commits
the recovered external chat row, then queues the synthesized `job` request-log/usage
entry, and only then claims the job. A failed chat save therefore leaves the job
available for retry without double-counting provider usage.

`TRACE_REQUEST_FOR_DEBUG=true` is a separate, opt-in HTTP debugging facility, not a
provider hook. Its middleware is installed after compression and before static serving
and mutation admission. It records only completed non-streaming HTTP exchanges to atomic
gzip files under `save/trace`, excludes streamed request bodies, streamed/SSE/NDJSON
responses, and WebSocket upgrades, and retains the newest 500 files. Traces include
headers and bodies and may contain sensitive data. The same gate injects
`globalThis.__PLUGIN_STORAGE_DIAG__` into the SPA so frontend plugin-storage diagnostics
are sent to the ordinary application log; it adds no provider API.

## 4. Entry points & dependencies

### Inbound entry points

- Production/self-hosted startup is `pnpm run runserver` → `server/node/server.cjs`, declared at `package.json:19`.
- Portable launchers and Termux scripts also execute the same file; `server.cjs` assumes `process.cwd()` is the PocketRisu application root.
- The frontend storage entry is the singleton `forageStorage = new AutoStorage()` at `src/ts/globalApi.svelte.ts:31`. `AutoStorage` constructs `NodeStorage`, which owns the HTTP contract.
- Direct settings-page fetches bypass `NodeStorage.authFetch()` for storage dashboards, snapshots, log viewing, update UI, and some backup preferences; their route references are listed above.
- The Hono entry points are runtime-specific exports or executables: `server/hono/src/bun.ts:1`, `server/hono/src/cf.ts:1`, and `server/hono/src/node.ts:1`.

### Outbound dependencies

- `better-sqlite3` supplies the synchronous application, diagnostic-log, request-log, and
  model-job databases.
- `msgpackr` and `fflate` implement RisuAI save compatibility in `server/node/utils.cjs:1`.
- `fast-json-patch` applies client patches at `server/node/server.cjs:73`.
- Express, `compression`, `express-rate-limit`, and `node-html-parser` provide HTTP routing, response compression, login throttling, and root-page flag injection.
- `ws` supplies the proxy-job WebSocket server in `server/node/runtime/proxy.cjs`.
- `wasm-vips` generates thumbnails and compresses inlays at `server/node/server.cjs:25`.
- Native `fetch` calls arbitrary authenticated proxy targets, `https://sv.risuai.xyz` for Hub traffic, Google OAuth, the configured PocketRisu update worker, and GitHub release assets.
- `child_process.spawn()` runs restart helpers; `execFileSync()` invokes archive tools with literal argument arrays during self-update.
- `server/hono/` depends only on Hono and `@hono/node-server`, declared at `server/hono/package.json:11`; it does not reuse the Node database, serialization, or route code.

## 5. Conventions & gotchas

### Process, configuration, and authentication

- Working directory is part of the contract. Storage, `dist/`, backups, package version,
  TLS certificates, binaries, and update paths are all based on `process.cwd()`, not
  `__dirname`. Starting from another directory creates/reads the wrong data tree.

- The server does not parse `.env`. Variables must already be in the process environment. Vite loads `.env` for dev/build. The in-app portable updater and `scripts/updater.cjs` preserve it, while the source `update.sh` and overwrite install path do not.

- Runtime requirements are slightly inconsistent. Root `package.json` declares Node
  `>=22.12.0`, while the server warns for any major version below 24.

- Authentication is NodeOnly-specific. PocketRisu replaced upstream's browser-side ECDSA
  flow with server-issued HMAC-SHA256 JWTs because remote HTTP is not a browser secure
  context; see `createServerJwt()` and the matching client warning in `nodeStorage.ts`.
  JWT lifetime is five minutes, while direct-asset session cookies last seven days.

- The password file contains whatever `/api/set_password` receives. The official client
  first hashes user input through unauthenticated `/api/crypto` and stores that digest as
  the password. Changing either side independently breaks login compatibility.

- Most authenticated routes return HTTP 400 for missing/expired/invalid JWTs, not consistently 401. `NodeStorage.shouldRetryAuth()` explicitly understands these response bodies at `src/ts/storage/nodeStorage.ts:257`.

- The direct-session cookie is a reauthentication credential. `/api/session` persists opaque tokens in `save/__sessions`, advertises optional protocol capabilities, and the cookie authorizes direct assets, flush/compress routes, and `/api/test_auth`, which can mint a fresh JWT. It is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, seven-day state, and intentionally not `Secure` for HTTP compatibility. Empty, non-JSON, missing, or capability-free session responses remain the legacy-server signal for client feature selection.

- JWT refresh has no maximum age beyond signature validity. `/api/token/refresh` disables expiration checking. Rotating `save/__jwt_secret` is the revocation boundary for a stolen signed token.

- Unset `HOST` binds all interfaces, and `/api/set_password` is intentionally unauthenticated while no password exists. Initial setup is therefore first-client-wins; bind `127.0.0.1` behind a reverse-access layer or set the password immediately on a trusted network.

- `GET /api/remove` is intentionally a mutating GET. This odd API is mirrored by `NodeStorage.removeItem()`; changing its verb requires a coordinated frontend compatibility change.

### Chats and database persistence

- Patch sync and chat lazy loading are inseparable. The patch baseline and live
  `database.bin` are stubs-only, while full messages live in chat rows. Any new stub
  metadata field must be added to shared `chatToStub()`/merge semantics, the server
  `STUB_METADATA_FIELDS` allowlist, and the client conversion.

- Key presence is semantically meaningful for stub metadata. Explicit `null`/`undefined` means “the user cleared this value”; it must overwrite the full chat. Do not replace the `in` checks in `mergeChatStubWithFullChat()` with nullish checks (`server/node/chat/chatRows.cjs:218`).

- There are multiple chat-corruption guards. Field-level patch operations outside the stub
  allowlist are rejected through `findChatInternalFieldOps()`; debounced stripped writes
  and full `/api/write` requests both reject metadata-only chats through
  `findStubFlagLossChats()`. Removing one reopens the silent message-loss path.

- Chat rows must go through `chatRows.cjs`. Key components are URI-encoded, large rows may have chunk manifests, and the row wire format must match `/api/chat-content`. Use `readChatRow()`, `writeChatRow()`/`writeChatRowRaw()`, and `deleteChatRow()` instead of hand-built keys or direct SQL (`server/node/chat/chatRows.cjs:16`, `server/node/chat/chatRows.cjs:246-266`).

- Raw chat writers make ownership explicit. `writeChatRowRaw()` preserves the caller's
  ownership by copying; `writeChatRowRawOwned()` consumes a Buffer and returns the SHA-256
  of the exact bytes published. Both atomically invalidate or publish the matching
  `chat_row_metadata` publication and clear any operation log. Imports/restores do not
  transport metadata or operation entries: they ingest the already materialized row as a
  fresh base. Legacy metadata gaps fall back to authoritative decode or a full-row write.

- Logical chat consumers must use the store materializer. Automatic snapshots, full and
  partial exports, monolith assembly, pre-images, duplication, and migrations therefore
  see base+log bytes exactly as if the client had sent the same content in a full-row POST.
  Do not read `chats/*` directly for a logical export.

- Chat deletion is layered and atomic with its stub graph. Patches collect old-minus-new row keys, force a `delete-chat` pre-image for every still-present row, and delete them only in the same transaction that persists the new `database.bin`; capture failure aborts publication. Cache-warm full writes and plugin-storage transitions use the same pre-delete guard. `/api/db/optimize` additionally sweeps unreferenced `chats/` rows but preserves rows updated within the last hour so a chat POST arriving before its stub is not lost.

- Duplicate character IDs are a row-key collision, not harmless metadata. Ingest repairs
  duplicate `chaId` values before externalizing rows and copies any referenced pre-existing
  stub rows into the new namespace; direct full writes reject duplicates at the boundary.

- `importBarrier.cjs` owns destructive-import exclusivity over the server's single writable
  SQLite connection, while `queueStorageMutation()` is the ordinary mutation boundary.
  Never acquire the barrier from inside a queued operation; the implementation would
  deadlock while draining that same queue. The full ordering and rollback contract is
  canonical in [backup and recovery](backup-recovery.md).

- Replacement outcome rows are deliberately outside KV so importing a new logical database cannot erase them. Register before dispatch, write `committed` in the same SQLite transaction as replacement publication, and expose only the authenticated status route. Startup may classify a leftover `running` row as `not-committed` precisely because a committed publication cannot exist without its transactional status update.

- Chat backups are pre-images, not post-save snapshots. For ordinary overwrites, `captureChatPreImage()` stays immediately before the chat-row write inside the shared storage queue; failures are logged and swallowed so recovery history cannot make a message save fail. Structural deletion is different: `captureChatDeletionPreImages()` holds the same queue, forces capture before the deleting transaction, and propagates failures so the row and stub graph remain authoritative. The newest version for each chat is protected during global budget eviction, but the ordinary 45-second cooldown means not every intermediate streaming/edit state is retained.

- Chat backup archives are filesystem-internal. IDs are path-component encoded and version IDs/reasons are strictly sanitized. Each current frame carries fixed magic plus a bounded header with codec, raw size/SHA-256, content type, and version metadata, followed by one gzip member. A derivative is authoritative only after streamed decompression and exact size/hash validation; reconciliation fsyncs its atomic publication before deleting a source. Legacy solid bundles remain readable and are withdrawn only after bounded extraction has durably published every entry. Use `chatBackups.cjs` rather than reading or rewriting this tree ad hoc.

- Downgrading after chat externalization is unsupported. Older servers interpret the live
  stubs-only blob as the whole database. Recovery for a downgrade is the boot-created
  `migration-backup/pre-chat-externalization-*` copy or another full pre-migration
  snapshot; see `migrateChatsToRowsIfNeeded()`.

- Optimized plugin publication is generation/manifest-bound. Ordinary `mutate` and
  `batch` operations pin the live backend generation and atomically publish their
  value/owner rows, the revised exact manifest, quota state, and recovery-dirty token;
  they do not replace `Database.pluginStorageGeneration`. Mode transitions instead
  require a fresh backend generation and atomically publish the database mode/generation,
  inline maps or external rows, exact manifest, quota state, and recovery token. Generic
  KV routes and JSON Patch cannot mutate those optimized roots or controls. A database
  patch may update only the inline value/owner maps after an authoritative inline-mode
  check. A manifest-changing `mutate` acknowledgement includes both the committed
  `manifestRevision` and `previousManifestRevision`. See
  [plugin storage](plugin-storage.md) for canonical cross-boundary publication semantics.

- `pluginStorageFolded` changes restore semantics. It proves a self-contained folded snapshot only with the selected generation/manifest contract. Exact restore replaces a proven owned set; unmarked historical snapshots retain external rows, and foreign/quarantined physical rows are not silently adopted.

### Plugin, cache, and protocol contracts

- Non-structural patch persistence is debounced and its acknowledgement is staged.
  `/api/patch` acknowledges after mutating memory with `durable: false`, then
  `persistDbCache()` writes five seconds later; structural chat-row-set changes
  instead persist before acknowledging with `durable: true`. Debounced failures
  cannot be returned on the triggering request, so `recordPersistFailure()`
  surfaces them on the next patch response; structural failures surface on the
  current one. Reads, backups, maintenance, shutdown, and the browser keepalive
  route explicitly flush pending data.

- Ordinary and segmented database ETags describe the canonical normalized legacy-encoded
  stripped client view. The raw boot route instead hashes the verbatim live row so corrupt
  or noncanonical bytes remain recoverable. `reconcileOptimizedPluginStorageForBoot()`
  derives and accepts either equivalent token inside one queued authoritative snapshot;
  full writes and patches must otherwise preserve the active token domain or clients will
  report false concurrent-modification conflicts.

- The browser resource cache is never authoritative. A cached database segment may be referenced only if the client advertised its hash, still has its bytes, and re-verifies SHA-256 before decoding. The assembled envelope ETag must match the response header. KV/chat `204` responses likewise require a locally advertised and re-hashed entry; every failure falls back to an unconditional server read.

- Delta lists depend on both timestamps and an epoch. `kvSet()` clears a matching
  tombstone after the live write, and client merge gives additions precedence if a crash
  exposes both records. Prefix deletes must journal keys before removal. Keep seven-day
  tombstones longer than the six-day delta window. `/api/list` stays behind
  `importBarrier.waitUntilIdle()`. Valid boot and destructive replacement commit/rollback
  paths rotate the epoch; corrupt-boot recovery deliberately performs no preflight
  mutation, and any epoch mismatch falls back to a full list.

- The compositional patch hash must remain byte-for-byte algorithmically aligned with the frontend. Property iteration order and normalization behavior in `calculateHash()`/`normalizeJSON()` are observable protocol details, not general-purpose utilities.

- RisuSave constants and defaults are duplicated across server and client. `RisuSaveType` and `presetTemplate` explicitly require synchronization at `server/node/utils.cjs:12` and `server/node/utils.cjs:57`.

- Legacy `REMOTE` data is migrated, not merely ignored.
  `migrateRemoteBlocksIfNeeded()` makes a dedicated safety backup, resolves
  `remotes/<name>.local.bin`, writes an inline legacy save, and keeps the old remote rows
  so pre-migration snapshots remain restorable.

- Cold-storage formats are another upstream compatibility boundary. Canonical runtime rows are gzipped `coldstorage/<uuid>`, while backup entries are plain JSON named `coldstorage/<uuid>.json`. Failed character restores become safe blank characters with a recovery breadcrumb.

### Files and protected chunks

- Inlay payloads no longer live in SQLite. Storage stats and backups must explicitly
  include `save/inlays`; `sumInlayFsBytes()` exists because KV prefix totals underreport
  them.

- Asset payloads mostly no longer live in SQLite either. Safe-named `assets/*` values are files in `save/assets/`; unsafe, non-portable, and host-case-colliding names remain KV rows. Never write an asset file in place — always temp-file + rename (`writeAssetFile()`), or an externally hardlinked copy in another instance would be corrupted. Live asset mutations must also use the asset store so they participate in `save/__asset_maintenance.lock`; a destructive asset swap must retain that lock until its import journal finalizes or rolls back. Anything enumerating or deleting assets must use the merged dual-source helpers (`listAssetEntriesWithSizes()`, `readAssetValue()`, `deleteAssetValue()`, `clearAllAssets()`), not `kvListWithSizes('assets/')` alone. Backup import stages asset files in `save/assets_import_staging/` and swaps atomically with rollback.

- Chunk-aware deletion matters. `kvDel()` must go through `chunkStore.dropValue()` so manifests stop pinning chunks. Direct SQL deletion of a chunked logical key leaves stale metadata until GC repairs it.

- A marker row alone is not proof of a chunked value. Protected publication metadata binds the complete sequence, chunk hashes, logical byte length, and whole-value SHA-256. Readers reject incomplete or corrupt publications with `KV_CHUNK_CORRUPT` instead of concatenating partial data.

- Contiguous protected reads allocate `logical_size` once and copy chunks into place.
  A publication is content-warm only when its persisted content-verification revision and
  the process-local verified memo both match the trigger-backed source revision. Warm
  reads still check manifest/chunk counts, sequence bounds, stored sizes, logical size,
  and canonical hash shape; any mismatch returns to the full per-chunk and logical SHA-256
  verifier. New buffer/file publications reuse write-time chunk hashes only after proving
  deduplicated chunk rows contain the exact stored bytes.

- The synchronous `kvGet()` contract remains intact. Async callers can use the Promise
  wrapper to single-flight identical reads, while bounded consumers can use the verified
  async iterator; `kvWriteToFile()` consumes that iterator and removes partial output on
  failure. Read-only pinned snapshot connections never write verification state. They may
  consume a live in-process proof only for the exact pinned source revision, and otherwise
  keep any successful full verification in a snapshot-local memo.

- Logical-size reads use stored `chunk_manifest_meta.logical_size` only while the
  publication's trigger-backed inventory revision matches its last authoritative
  COUNT/sequence/stored-byte verification. Direct changes to marker, manifest, metadata,
  publication, or referenced chunk rows invalidate that proof. Size listings fall back
  through one grouped aggregate query rather than one COUNT/SUM pair per value.

- Chat and optimized-plugin dashboard totals are chunk-aware. Logical totals come from
  revision-verified size inventories; `LENGTH(kv.value)` would report only the 13-byte
  marker for a chunked value. `/api/db/stats` names the optimized category
  `pluginStorage`, with `count`, logical `totalSize`, physical `kvRowSize` and
  `chunkBytes`, and their combined `physicalSize`. Shared chunks are attributed to chats
  first, then plugin storage, leaving the remainder in the database slice so dashboard
  categories do not double-count the chunk table.

- Chunk GC is deliberately off the save hot path. Replaced chunks become orphans and are
  reclaimed during `/api/db/optimize`.

- Snapshot “size” has two meanings. Rotation limits use exclusive physical chunk cost:
  chunks referenced by that manifest and no other manifest (`snapshotCostExclusive()`).
  The list endpoint reports logical reassembled DB size. Do not substitute
  `LENGTH(kv.value)`, which is only the marker for chunked values.
- Multi-snapshot usage and trimming obtain all exclusive costs from one grouped
  reference-count query per accounting pass. Trimming still recomputes after each
  deletion because a removed sibling can make shared chunks exclusive to a survivor.

- Snapshot assembly is independent of file backups. Temporary `database.risudat` files
  belong in the installation-owned namespace of `save/.spool` or `POCKETRISU_SPOOL_DIR`, never
  under the optional server-backup path. On POSIX, boot first completes the namespace claim, atomically
  quarantines only that stable child, creates a fresh private child, compares the pinned old
  identity to the pre-rename source, and sweeps through pinned old/fresh descriptors. Recognized
  artifacts are removed through the old fd; unrelated regular files publish create-only into the
  fresh fd while their original links remain quarantined, and conflicts retain both versions.
  After pinned work, the quarantine pathname is retained unconditionally; no post-close pathname
  deletion can target a replacement object. If descriptor-relative access
  is unavailable, deletion is skipped and runtime spooling remains unavailable. All later spool
  consumers use the process-lifetime pinned fresh fd. Peer namespaces, pathname replacements,
  symlink targets, and unowned legacy root files are therefore preserved. Automatic snapshots stream the pinned source into a private finished file outside
  the storage queue, then stream that file through `kvSetFromFile()` only after a queued
  global-token comparison. They contain their own failures; advance `lastBackupTime` only
  after the snapshot row commits so a spool failure retries on the next write. Pending
  database flushes feed this same scheduler rather than assembling against live rows.
  Canonical and legacy decoded stream-load temporaries use shared name families in
  the same configured owned child and are recognized by its boot sweep. Production
  decode boundaries fail closed when that pinned spool is unavailable. On Windows, runtime
  consumers instead share a unique `.runtime-*` child created for that process; boot and exit
  never recursively delete a reusable namespace pathname, so stale children are retained.

- Automatic snapshot timestamps use 100 ms units. Creation divides `Date.now()` by 100;
  listing multiplies the parsed value by 100.

### Backup and import boundaries

- Backup readers need one point in time. Full/server exports combine a pinned WAL view with private verified filesystem copies and disk reservations before emitting headers. Do not enumerate live SQLite or reread live filesystem paths during output; see [Backup and recovery](backup-recovery.md).

- Backup stream responses must remain uncompressed and incrementally flushed.
  `shouldCompress()` excludes proxy, download, SSE, and NDJSON cases. Re-enabling gzip can
  buffer heartbeats and reintroduce reverse-proxy timeouts.

- Backup imports are implemented by `importBackupFromSource()`, `importSpool.cjs`,
  `importBarrier.cjs`, and `importJournal.cjs`; preserve those bounded-ingress,
  exclusivity, and SQLite/filesystem publication boundaries. Import ordering, recovery,
  and outcome classification are canonical in
  [backup and recovery](backup-recovery.md).

### Proxy, deployment, and observability

- `/proxy` and proxy jobs have different trust models. Authenticated `/proxy` and `/proxy2`
  accept general HTTP(S) targets, while job/WebSocket streaming validates local/private
  hosts through `sanitizeTargetUrl()`. Do not reuse the unrestricted proxy path for the
  local-network feature.

- Hosted proxy policy lives in `server/node/runtime/proxyTarget.cjs`. With
  `POCKETRISU_HUB_HOSTING` enabled, general proxy requests use a DNS-pinning undici
  dispatcher that rejects non-public resolutions and blocked literal redirect targets on
  every connection; local proxy-stream job creation/WebSocket upgrades are disabled.
  Standalone general proxy requests keep global `fetch` and local-network access.

- `/hub-proxy/*` is not universally guarded by `checkAuth()`: PocketRisu authentication
  is checked only for the special `X-Node-Server-Auth` conversion flow. Nevertheless,
  `resolveHubProxyTarget()` restricts both the default route and an `x-risu-node-path`
  override to the configured HTTPS Hub origin. Header/target changes remain a deliberate
  compatibility and security boundary.

- Tailscale has no backend implementation. It is an external reverse-access recommendation using `tailscale serve --bg http://localhost:6001`, documented in `../../docs-human/en/remote.md`.

- Self-update is portable-only and mutates the installation tree. Only a `.portable`
  deployment can enter the replacement flow. The keep sets, rollback staging, Windows
  locked-binary handling, and restart logic are data-safety behavior. Archive paths are
  passed to tools as literal arguments, generated batch paths escape percent expansion,
  and the native launcher uses dynamic buffers plus a long-path-aware manifest.

- Logs are a separate bounded database. Rows are rotated to approximately 5,000, descriptions are truncated, and common JWT/API-key patterns are masked before persistence (`server/node/runtime/logs.cjs:8`, `server/node/runtime/logs.cjs:62`). Keep the server `BACKGROUND_SOURCES` list synchronized with the frontend logs settings as noted at `server/node/runtime/logs.cjs:55`.

- Fatal logging intentionally terminates the process. `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` synchronously persist a record, run the guarded emergency database flush (`runEmergencyDbFlush()` in `dbCachePersistence.cjs`, wired through `installProcessHandlers({ onFatalExit })`), and call `process.exit(1)` (`server/node/runtime/logs.cjs:332-384`).

- The SSL helper is local-development oriented. Its certificate SANs cover only localhost, and the shell helper sets private keys to mode `0644` at `server/node/ssl/Generate Certificate.sh:7`; do not treat it as a hardened public-deployment certificate setup.

- The Hono tree is not feature-compatible. It has only `GET /`, CSRF, and optional static serving. Moreover, `server/hono/package.json:5` references missing `src/index.ts`, and `server/hono/wrangler.jsonc:3` references missing `src/index.js`. Treat it as scaffold code rather than an alternate PocketRisu backend.

## 6. Navigation hints

- To add or change an HTTP route, start in its owning route module (including
  `backup/backupRoutes.cjs`, `db/maintenanceRoutes.cjs`, `plugin-storage/pluginStorageRoutes.cjs`,
  and `runtime/{observability,proxy,selfUpdate}.cjs`) or the retained route block in
  `server/node/server.cjs`; keep `expressErrorMiddleware` after all registrations/routes.

- To change request-size limits, static caching, compression, or streaming behavior,
  inspect the Express middleware and `shouldCompress()`.

- To change startup, bind/TLS selection, WebSockets, or shutdown, inspect `startServer()`
  and the final startup IIFE. New environment variables should follow existing direct
  `process.env` reads and document launcher behavior.

- To change authentication or direct-asset sessions, update `createServerJwt()`,
  `checkAuth()`, `sessionAuthMiddleware`, `/api/session`, and `NodeStorage` together.

- To change writer authority, update `server/node/runtime/session-lock.cjs`,
  `checkActiveSession()`, `/api/session/lock-status`, and the client session/activity
  headers together.

- To change generic KV behavior, pinned WAL readers, list epochs, or SQLite tuning, start
  in `server/node/db/db.cjs`. Large-blob thresholds, FastCDC boundaries, protected
  publication, snapshot sharing, and GC live in `server/node/db/chunkStore.cjs`.

- To change boot/read/write synchronization, inspect `/api/read`,
  `/api/db/read-cached`, `/api/db/read-raw-for-boot`,
  `/api/db/create-if-absent`, `/api/plugin-storage/reconcile-boot`,
  `server/node/db/dbCachedRead.cjs`, and `NodeStorage.readDatabaseForBoot()` together.

- To change optimized plugin recovery management, update the inspection/download/resolve
  routes, their proof token and atomic publication helpers, the matching `NodeStorage`
  validators, `PluginSettings.svelte`, and the boot-reconcile compatibility tests
  together. Preserve the encoded-key-only diagnostic boundary.

- To change verified browser-cache negotiation, update `parseCachedHashesHeader()` and
  `sha256Hex()` in `server/node/utils.cjs`, the hash-aware database/KV/chat routes, and
  `src/ts/storage/resourceCache.ts` together.

- To change key-list deltas, update `server/node/db/listDelta.cjs`, deletion/epoch helpers in
  `server/node/db/db.cjs`, `/api/list`, replacement epoch bumps, and `NodeStorage.keys()`.

- To change patch sync, inspect `findChatInternalFieldOps()`, `persistDbCache()`,
  `/api/patch`, and the matching `RisuSavePatcher`/normalization code.

- To add chat-level metadata, update `chatToStub()`/`mergeChatStubWithFullChat()` in
  `chatRows.cjs`, both `STUB_METADATA_FIELDS` allowlists, and the client conversions.
  Chat-row identity, ingestion, assembly, and orphan cleanup also start in
  `server/node/chat/chatRows.cjs`.

- To change chat hydration or row persistence, inspect `/api/chat-content`,
  `NodeStorage.fetchChatContent()`/`saveChatContent()`, `chatPersistStage.ts`, and
  `ensureChatHydrated()`. Per-chat pre-image formats and retention live in
  `server/node/chat/chatBackups.cjs`.

- To change recoverable provider requests, inspect `server/node/runtime/model-jobs.cjs`,
  `src/ts/process/request/jobRecovery.ts`, and the model-preset transport together.
  Preserve the external chat-row save before request logging and claim.

- To change provider diagnostics or token accounting, inspect
  `server/node/runtime/request-logs.cjs` and `src/ts/requestLog.ts`. Diagnostic application logs
  remain separately owned by `server/node/runtime/logs.cjs`.

- To change RisuAI format compatibility or monolith ingestion, inspect
  `server/node/utils.cjs`, `server/node/backup/streamRisuLoad.cjs`, `ingestDatabase()`,
  `ingestFullDatabase()`, and `ingestStreamingDatabase()`; compare client codecs before
  changing constants.

- To change boot migrations, start at `migrateChatsToRowsIfNeeded()`,
  `migrateRemoteBlocksIfNeeded()`, `externalizePluginStorageIfNeeded()`, and
  `migrateInlaysToFilesystem()` as appropriate.

- To change asset storage or cleanup, inspect `server/node/assets/assetStore.cjs`,
  `server/node/assets/assetGc.cjs`, `collectDatabaseAssetReferences()`, and
  `runServerAssetCleanup()`. Statistics and deletion deliberately share the same
  plugin-aware reachability scan.

- To change backup framing/import, inspect `server/node/backup/backupEntryFormat.cjs`,
  `importBackupFromSource()`, `server/node/backup/importSpool.cjs`,
  `server/node/backup/importBarrier.cjs`, and `server/node/backup/importJournal.cjs`.

- To change snapshot creation, plugin folding, spooling, retention, or cost, inspect
  `createBackupAndRotate()`, `snapshotFootprint()`, `server/node/plugin-storage/pluginSaveKeys.cjs`, and
  the snapshot routes.

- To change proxy target policy, inspect `server/node/runtime/proxyTarget.cjs` and
  `server/node/runtime/proxy.cjs` (`sanitizeTargetUrl()`, the general proxy handlers,
  and proxy-stream WebSockets), plus model jobs;
  each transport has a different target policy.

- To change update checks or portable replacement, inspect
  `server/node/runtime/selfUpdate.cjs` (which owns `fetchLatestRelease()` and the
  public/update routes), `src/ts/update.ts`, `scripts/updater.cjs`, `update.sh`, and
  `server/node/recoveryPathMarkers.cjs` together. All destructive updater paths require
  an absent startup-quarantine transaction plus both durable recovery-root markers, and
  fail closed when any of that preservation state cannot be validated.
  Backup-path mutation and self-update admission share an in-process queue plus the
  token-owned `save/__recovery_path_state.lock` exclusion used by standalone updaters
  and second server processes; the former uses a durable old/new marker set across its
  KV and live-root transition. Startup first records the union of prior quarantine,
  marker history, and current authoritative roots in the atomic/fsynced
  `save/__recovery_path_startup_quarantine`, then publishes both recovery marker sets
  under one acquisition before any root fallback/use, clearing the transaction only
  after both markers are durable. Marker failure is therefore recoverable on the next
  clean startup; corrupt/uncertain quarantine state retains the token lock. Source updates never replace live `save/`;
  Windows parent processes atomically hand the token to the batch finalizer, which keeps
  ownership through bin/version work and performs the only release. Never age/PID-steal an ambiguous crash-stale lock: verify
  the owner is gone and remove that exact directory explicitly. Marker publication may
  retain inaccessible historical paths lexically so startup can fall back, but updater
  consumption must still canonicalize them or refuse replacement. Preserve actual
  directory-entry casing and use platform-aware comparison in every destructive loop.

- To make Hono functional, begin with `server/hono/src/app/index.ts`, but plan explicit
  replacements for authentication, SQLite/chunk storage, backup streaming, WebSockets,
  and runtime-specific filesystem/process features.
